ysk14,1,Summarize dynamic opinion diffusion.
ysk14,1,an overview of opinion propagation is essential for them to begin their investigation and analysis.
ysk14,1,As a large-scale event usually include many topics, the domain experts want to see and compare the opinion diffusion among users in different topics over time.
ysk14,1,the main topics, opinion diffusion within each topic, and user transition behavior should be visually conveyed in the overview.
ysk14,1,smoothly explore opinion diffusion from the high level to the low level
ysk14,1,With this function, they can explore a single event and its related opinion diffusion under different time granularities.
ysk14,1,it is preferred to propagate positive opinions over the long term.
ysk14,1,observe and compare opinion diffusion with respect to different topics
ysk14,2,OpinionFlow
ysk14,2,we design an opinion flow visualization that combines a Sankey graph with a tailored density map in one view to visually convey diffusion of opinions among many users.
ysk14,2,combines a Sankey graph with an improved density map to visually convey the flow of opinions among users.
ysk14,2,Opinion Flow to visually summarize the opinion diffusion by using a novel combination of a Sankey graph and a tailored density map.
ysk14,2,we design a new visualization method called Opinion Flow that combines a Sankey graph and a tailored density map to display the dynamics of opinion flow.
ysk14,2,To illustrate opinion diffusion and the transition between different topics, this visualization combines a Sankey diagram with KDE. The following sections describe the visual design, opinion kernels used in KDE, kernel placement strategy, and supported user interactions.
ysk14,2,on the diagrams, various visualization techniques have been built, such as TextFlow.
ysk14,2,We employ density maps to visually represent the diffusion of opinions among users based on the following considerations.
ysk14,2,density maps can be extended to produce a diffusion effect similar to that in the real world
ysk14,2,Therefore, density maps can show not only opinion distribution, but also diffusion orientation.
ysk14,2,Moreover, visualization based on KDE density maps enable diffusion intersections and diffusion strengths to vary.
ysk14,2,We apply a Gaussian kernel in our KDE algorithm to visually display an opinion of a user and its possible diffusion direction with regard to a topic at a certain time stamp.
ysk14,2,Gaussian kernel is flexible and can be modified to convey orientation information.
ysk14,2,The proposed system allows a user to explore opinion diffusion across a relatively large number of users using a hierarchical topic structure built by BRT.
ysk14,3,In density maps, red and green visually encode negative and positive opinions, respectively.
ysk14,3,The size of a keyword visually encodes the keyword frequency in the topic.
ysk14,3,We can also observe some transition lines between different topic strips. Each line that connects two topic strips represents the amount of user attention that flows between the two corresponding topics.
ysk14,3,The attention level of at user i to topic k at time t is the number of the tweets of the topic divided by the total number of all the tweets (posted by the user at time t).
ysk14,3,The height of the corresponding topic strip at time t is then determined by the aggregated attention of all the users (who post tweets about topic k at time t).
ysk14,3,An edge with a higher priority will be more likely to have attention transition.
ysk14,3,We sort the topic strips according to size. We then position the strip with the largest number of users.
ysk14,3,Some negative opinions (in red regions) could also be observed, which could be attributed to a variety of factors such as compatibility issues.
ysk14,3,the green region (positive opinions) highlighted in a dashed rectangle in the asylum topic.
ysk14,3,To enable a user to better relate a strip to a topic, we also place the keywords of the topic obtained by the BRT model onto the corresponding topic strip (see the blue labels)
ysk14,4,we design an opinion flow visualization that combines a Sankey graph
ysk14,4,A stacked tree is used to allow analysts to select topics of interest at different levels. The stacked tree is synchronized with the opinion flow visualization to help users examine and compare diffusion patterns across topics.
ysk14,4,Bayesian Rose Tree (BRT) model to detect a multi-branch hierarchy of topics from a large number of tweets and display the topic hierarchy by using a stacked topic tree.
ysk14,4,The tree is linked to opinion flow to help users facilitate analysis of opinion diffusion in different topics.
ysk14,4,The stacked tree enables an analyst to easily navigate numerous tweets by organizing them according to a topic hierarchy.
ysk14,4,we employ a state-of-the-art method of hierarchical clustering called BRT to extract topics from a large collection of trees.
ysk14,4,After that, we use BRT to construct a topic hierarchy from the aggregated tweets.
ysk14,4,we determine a topic hierarchy based on the tweets, we draw a stacked tree.
ysk14,4,This tree is a combination of stacked tree nodes and tree nodes composed of node-link diagrams.

mdd10,2,Image Cloud encoding the popularity of event photos by size.
mdd10,2,In order to give new perspectives on backchannel conversations, we introduce Topic Streams, a temporally and topically adjustable stacked graph that visualizes topics extracted from digital backchannel conversations. This is accompanied by two compact visualizations, People Spiral and an Image Cloud, presenting visual aggregates of active participants and shared images.
mdd10,2,the notion of evolving visualizations that integrate representations of current activity and recent development in continuous information streams, such as digital backchannels.
mdd10,2,Topic Streams
mdd10,2,People Spiral
mdd10,2,Topic Streams: a visualization representing topical development
mdd10,2,The primary visualization using the most screen real estate is Topic Streams, a stacked graph visualization of conversation topics, below which there is a People Spiral, a helical view of the most active participants, and an Image Cloud featuring photographs taken during an event.
mdd10,2,The topic visualization is also accompanied by textual labels.
mdd10,2,we designed the People Spiral layout consisting of dots and labels representing backchannel participants and their activity
mdd10,2,dot in the spiral stands for a participant
mdd10,2,The Image Cloud is a lightweight view for socially shared images, inspired by the widespread use of tag clouds on the Web.
mdd10,3,offer a dynamic and appealing interface. Colours, shapes, and arrangements should be accessible, inviting, and visually pleasing.
mdd10,3,we decided to order by general newness of a topic from top to bottom of the streams.
mdd10,3,the y-axis is used to encode relative frequency of topics by the vertical width of the stream corresponding to a topic at a particular time point.
mdd10,3,The mapping from newness to colour is done in the HSV (hue, saturation, value) colour space. We choose a subset of the hue spectrum between blue and green, with the newest topics represented by green and the oldest in blue. To make the streams of newer topics appear brighter and more saturated we map greater newness to higher saturation and higher value.
mdd10,3,The stream shapes are defined by cubic Bezier curves
mdd10,3,While the vertical width of an individual stream at a specific time interval is determined by the relative number of topic occurrences in tweets during this time bin, the overall sum of the stream widths per time interval corresponds to the sum of occurrences of these most popular topics.
mdd10,3,The font size of the label is correlated with the overall number of occurrences of the topic in this time window and its colour is a darker tone of the colour of the stream.
mdd10,3,The opacity of a highlight depends on the relative frequency that a topic was mentioned.

caa20,0,Multiple Items
caa20,0,items occurring in the streams
caa20,0,the streams having the same positions along the time or in the sequence.
caa20,0,A data stream is an ordered collection of data records in which each record refers to a time moment or a position (step) in a sequence. In our research, we consider data streams in which data records include or refer to multiple different items (entities of any nature), denoted by their labels. Apart from the temporal or sequential references and labeled items, data in the streams may include other components. We shall refer to them as attributes.
caa20,0,In social media, the comparison target can be text streams, such as a series of tweets, produced by different users. The items in these streams are meaningful keywords used in the texts. One can select different sub-streams of these streams for comparison based on attributes of the data, such as text topic, or location from which the messages were posted, or the time of the day when the texts were produced.
caa20,0,target is the sequences of the actions and events that happened under the ball possession by the two teams. The items are the players, the actions performed by them, and events like goal or foul.
caa20,0,depicting local trends, increase or decrease.

caa20,0,we processed 3,416 tweets from Hillary Clinton (indicated by pink) and Donald Trump (blue) in the 2016 presidential election in the USA.
caa20,1,Pair-wise Visual Connection and Comparison
caa20,1,Comparison is an important and general task in data analysis.
caa20,1,Our research goal is to provide a general solution supporting pair-wise comparison of multi-item data streams in terms of the involvement of different items along time.
caa20,1,pair-wise visual connection and comparison of multi-item data streams
caa20,1,both qualitative and quantitative comparisons
caa20,1,Comparison of data stream dynamics: Compare the temporal or sequential patterns of data streams, focusing on the numerical trends at different levels of granularity.
caa20,1,Comparison of items: Provide qualitative comparison (common or distinct) and quantitative comparison (relative frequencies, absolute amounts, etc.) of the items in the streams.
caa20,1,Comparison of comparisons: Compare overall similarity difference patterns and numeric trends of different pairs of sub streams.
caa20,1,Comparison of sub-stream pairs, which requires a compact representation of the similarities and differences and their dynamics in each pair.
caa20,1,Users obtain an abstracted visual summary of dynamic similarity-difference patterns of a pair of data streams. Summaries for different sub-stream pairs can be compared.
caa20,1,supporting comparison of two streams
caa20,1,We need to make connections between corresponding parts of the two streams for presenting their similarities and differences regarding the items involved.
caa20,1,Qualitative comparison of the presence of items in the two streams is supported by showing the item labels.
caa20,1,For a more detailed exploration, users need to select subsets of the data, further referred to as sub-streams.
caa20,1,Co-Bridges, users can observe the overall temporal pattern by scanning sequentially along the river direction.
caa20,1,In the iterative process, various insights can be derived by exploring different aspects of the data streams.
caa20,1,Comparative exploration of the tweets of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the U.S Presidential Election Campaign of 2016.
caa20,1,Visual Summary Level: Comparison of Comparison
caa20,1,The iterative exploration and Comparison of comparisons enabled us to compare multiple aspects of the two data streams.
caa20,2,Co-Bridges
caa20,2,Co-Bridges use river and bridge metaphors, where two sides of a river represent data streams, and bridges connect temporally or sequentially aligned segments of streams.
caa20,2,A bridge connects corresponding segments of two data streams.
caa20,2,Multiple items appearing in these parts of the streams are shown on the bridge.
caa20,2,River Curve
caa20,2,Bars on the bridge
caa20,2,We base on a river-and-bridge metaphor in the visualisation design. The river metaphor is quite often adopted for representing data streams.
caa20,2,In Co-Bridges, each of the two river sides represents one data stream. We choose to show the river flow along the vertical display dimension; hence, the time or sequence is encoded by the vertical axis. The vertical layout allows several river instances to be juxtaposed in a display.
caa20,2,shown on the bridges connecting corresponding parts of the river sides
caa20,2,Combining the river and bridge visual metaphors, Co-Bridges is a design including multiple connecting bridges for visual comparison of two multi-item data streams associated with two sides of a river.
caa20,2,Our design builds on the Theme River metaphor, which presents a single multi-item stream.
caa20,2,We maintain the basic concept and appearance of a river but use the river sides to refer to two streams.
caa20,2,we introduce the metaphor of bridges, which fits naturally to the river metaphor.
caa20,2,Between the river sides, there are multiple bridges connecting the corresponding parts, according to the time or sequential steps, of the two data streams.
caa20,2,The bridge interior is divided into blocks representing different items.
caa20,2,To mark the exact time range, there are two gray curved lines linking the bridge sides to the accurate temporal or sequential positions on the river banks.
caa20,2,The two sides of the trapezoid of the bridge imitate the shape of the riverbanks, thus depicting local trends, increase or decrease.
caa20,2,The line plots making the river sides represent the evolution of a quantitative aspect of the data streams.
caa20,3,Block Size/Ratio/Position
caa20,3,The shapes of the river sides encode the evolution of numeric features of the data streams, e.g., stream volumes.
caa20,3,Two distinct colors are assigned to indicate the two data streams and their items.
caa20,3,The size of an item block encodes the frequency of the appearance of this item, the degree of item involvement in each stream, or other numeric information concerning the item.
caa20,3,we processed 3,416 tweets from Hillary Clinton (indicated by pink) and Donald Trump (blue) in the 2016 presidential election in the USA.
caa20,3,Each item block has two color regions, encoding the item frequencies in the corresponding stream.
caa20,3,Thus, to enable assessment of frequency differences, 3 visual variables are used: position(order), color and size.
caa20,3,The width of a bridge (in the 2D visualization, refers to the vertical length of a bridge) encodes the accumulated frequency of the items.
caa20,3,but each bridge has a different width proportional to the combined stream volumes.
caa20,3,Quantitative comparison is supported by employing the sizes and positions of the item blocks, the heights of the curves, and the height of the bars on the bridges.
caa20,3,We support multiple ways of selecting sub-streams to be compared.
caa20,3,The size and/or color of a node can encode item-related information.
caa20,3,In particular, the node size can encode the overall frequency, and colored segments can represent the frequencies in the two streams.
caa20,4,The two sides of the river are line charts showing the evolution of a numeric characteristic, such as the volume, of the two data streams.
caa20,4,The bridge interior is used to visualize items from two data streams aggregated over the respective time or sub-sequence of steps.
caa20,4,There is a bar in the corner of each side of the bridge, which can be customized for showing value statistics of some numeric attributes for the period the bridge corresponds to.
caa20,4,The time or sequence length is equally distributed among the bridges,
caa20,4,The line plots making the river sides represent the evolution of a quantitative aspect of the data streams.
caa20,4,Qualitative comparison of the presence of items in the two streams is supported by showing the item labels.
caa20,4,side by side as small multiple displays
caa20,4,The line plots (river sides) show the amounts of the tweets mentioning “great”.
caa20,4,We set the heights of the black bars on the bridges to show the counts of the followers who liked the tweets in the corresponding periods. We can see that Trump tweets got more 'likes'.
caa20,4,Each item has a descriptive label: keyword, action name, entity name, event category
caa20,4,We provide three ways to enable users to select sub-streams for comparison: textual query, item graph node selection, and iterative attribute-based filtering applied to the currently explored (sub)set.
caa20,4,We create a graph display of the items and their co-occurrence relationships. Each node represents an item.
caa20,4,A link between two nodes indicates the co-occurrence relationship between two items. If two items occur together more often, their positions will be closer in the force-directed layout.

astc06,2,CrystalChat focuses on the social interaction centered around one person, supporting self exploration of one’s own chat history.
astc06,2,six spokes that each represents conversations with a given person.
astc06,2,CrystalChat visual representation
astc06,2,The number of facets represents the number of people that were chosen to be displayed.
astc06,2,Each facet starts from the empty central hub and points outward like spokes in a wheel.
astc06,2,Temporal ordering of a facet
astc06,2,To clarify the view of the facet that is being examined, a translucent shield is placed directly behind it.
astc06,2,A colored disc represents a single message.
astc06,2,the person whose chat network is displayed is represented by a neutral colour grey so that all colour choices for other people will show well in contrast.
astc06,2,one circle represents one message in CrystalChat.
astc06,2,The row in CrystalChat represents the conversation that occurred within a given message window.
astc06,2,We mentioned earlier that translucent planes were added for readability for the side view.
astc06,2,The hexagonal shape results from the choice to display one’s conversations with six people.
astc06,3,Since location and orientation create the hub and spoke diagram this leaves visual variables such as colour, size, shape, (light and dark) value, and texture.
astc06,3,each colour indicates a different person
astc06,3,the person whose chat network is displayed is represented by a neutral colour grey so that all colour choices for other people will show well in contrast.
astc06,3,the messages are arranged so that the first message in the conversation starts on the left.
astc06,3,Colour is used to identify individual people.
astc06,3,Still using a subtle colour, the plane can be used to display information about conversational tone.
astc06,3,The neutral colour of the plane is pale yellow.
astc06,3,Moving the screen up or down to a different level will also cause colour changes as the use of emoticons changes.
astc06,3,The colors of the translucent plane change according to the amount of emoticons used.
astc06,3,The darker the color value of the message circle, the more characters that are typed for that message.
astc06,3,We use this term value to mean the relative lightness or darkness of a given hue by increasing or decreasing the RGB values.
astc06,3,One can spot at a glance the more verbose conversations from those that consist of quicker word responses.
astc06,4,Our design is based on combining the social network and the temporal aspect into one 3D representational structure.
astc06,4,CrystalChat is a fully interactive 3D hub and spoke structure.
astc06,4,This mode of representation takes more space but does reveal the temporal interspacing of conversations between different people, thus providing relative time spacing.
astc06,4,The timeline is still vertical and increases upwards. In this view, when temporal data is used explicitly, each row of messages corresponds to the conversations in one day.
astc06,4,In creating navigation interactions with CrystalChat, our purpose is not to limit the navigation power but to provide 3D interaction paths that give freedom without causing the viewer to lose themselves in 3D screen space.
lln14,0,Social Media
lln14,0,For example, the US presidential election debates in 2012 triggered a series of arguments because of the different political views of two parties.
lln14,0,It attracted great attention of the public, leading to heated discussions on Twitter.
lln14,0,On social media sites, some people show their support by expressing positive comments on certain persons or events, while others may attack their opponents with negative words.
lln14,0,to highlight three major factors of the divergence: who—the social groups involved, when—the time-evolving sentiment trends of social groups, and why—the summarized conversations related to the evolutions of the sentiments, providing the context.
lln14,0,We first estimate sentiments of individual users at each timestamp.
lln14,0,Then, a hierarchical clustering is performed to group users based on their sentiment trends over time.
lln14,0,a sentiment divergence during the US presidential election.

lln14,0,A series of conversations corresponding to the evolution of sentiments
lln14,0,providing a summary of the focused event context.
lln14,0,from the rich and massive social media data.
lln14,0,A typical social divergence process is usually represented as different opinions expressed by groups of users towards the same topics or events over time.
lln14,0,we decompose these data into several key factors including: (1) temporal extent of social communities, (2) topics or events, and (3) user responses to the topics and events.
lln14,0,The processes include data filtering and segmentation, user sentiment estimation, and user clustering.
lln14,0,We collected US presidential debate (held on October 3, 11, 16, and 22, 2012) data from the 10 % Twitter stream.
lln14,1,Social media allow people to express and promote different opinions, on which people sentiments to a subject often diverge when their opinions conflict.
lln14,1,SocialHelix is a novel visual design which enables the users to detect and trace topics and events occurring in social media, and to understand when and why divergences occurred and how they evolved among different social groups.
lln14,1,to recognize a sentiment divergence and trace the different sentiment divergence processes in social media.

lln14,1,detect and trace social divergences
lln14,1,When does a divergence start and end? How does it evolve?
lln14,1,Tracing the evolution trend of users’ opinions helps with the divergence detection and showing an overall view facilitates the data interpretation and comparison.
lln14,1,Who are involved in each divergence side? What roles do they play?
lln14,1,Understanding their roles and separating them into groups will help identify general patterns of user behaviors and detect anomalies.
lln14,1,Why does a divergence occur?
lln14,1,Understanding the reasons of a divergence is the most important task in the social divergence analysis.
lln14,1,The visualization should be able to reveal temporal data patterns that represent the complete process of a social divergence.
lln14,1,The visualization should highlight the people who were involved in the divergence.
lln14,1,The visualization should capture the key events that result in the divergence.
lln14,1,we cluster users based on their sentiment similarities over time to generate social communities and analyze the divergence between them by comparing the relative positions of two community strands.
lln14,1,understanding the concrete reasons causing the sentiment divergence requires to drilling down into the details and tracing the specific topics and the corresponding events.
lln14,1,we found that this divergence appeared when Romney criticized Obama stance on Israel, saying that the president did not hold the Jewish state in a tight enough embrace.
lln14,2,SocialHelix
lln14,2,a novel visual design inspired by DNA helices
lln14,2,the visualization represents information details of related social events as boxes that connect two community strands
lln14,2,These two communities are visualized as two curving strands polarized between positive–negative sentiment poles along with a timeline.
lln14,2,based on the metaphor of a DNA molecule.
lln14,2,strands that look like double-stranded helices.
lln14,2,are shown as keyword boxes in the middle that connect these two strands,
lln14,2,we represent the transformed data into an intuitive visualization designed based on a visual metaphor of a DNA helix.
lln14,2,The overall design is based on a metaphor of a DNA molecule that consists of two twisting helices.
lln14,2,we use the entireDNAmolecule to represent a focused topic.
lln14,2,Strand represents a user community involved in this topic over time.
lln14,2,The double-stranded helix represents two community strands.
lln14,2,The helix curves show the overall changes of the communities sentiment over time.
lln14,2,The nucleobase pairs represent events that connect the two communities.
lln14,2,This design consists of three major components, namely, community strand, event box, and user group to represent three key factorsdiscussed above, respectively.
lln14,2,A community strand represents the evolution of a community comprised of a group of people with similar sentiments who are involved in the focused topic.
lln14,2,we polarize the community strand between two sentiment poles (e.g., positive and negative) and interpolate the data samples at different timestamps along a horizontal timeline. Thus, a smooth curving strand is created.
lln14,2,The visual cue formed by the community strands is naturally coincident with the anti-parallel and double-stranded structure of DNA helices.
lln14,2,the box connecting two community strands illustrates an event that involves users from both communities
lln14,2,Inside the event box, keywords are represented as small bars.
lln14,2,A user group is visualized as a circle embedded within the community strand.
lln14,2,A community strand should be a smooth belt representation since users change their sentiments smoothly and continuously in most of the time.
lln14,3,the sentiment information is quantitatively represented as the screen distance between a community strand and a sentiment pole.
lln14,3,the sentiment information is also represented by a color gradient from green to red, pertaining to two sentiment poles.
lln14,3,The community size implies its influence and is encoded as the thickness of the strand.
lln14,3,The sentiment pole ‘positive (in green)’ and ‘negative (in red)’ are preselected and placed at the top and the bottom side of the view, respectively.
lln14,3,Two communities are polarized between them as curving strands with gradient colors corresponding to their sentiments.
lln14,3,The community strands with intense emotional polarities run in opposite directions, implying the sentiment divergence.
lln14,3,The size and color of the bar encode the normalized frequency and the sentiment of the keyword, respectively.
lln14,3,an event box size varies based on the distance between two community strands. This design spontaneously assigns more space and forms a multi-foc view for displaying the details when divergence is large.
lln14,3,more spaces are provided in the middle for rendering the details of corresponding events and their keywords.
lln14,3,The users within the group are represented as dots whose sizes and colors represent the usersnormalized activeness and their sentiments, respectively.
lln14,3,The thickness of a strand represents the community size that may vary overtime.
lln14,3,we lay out event keywords within the event box by their polarities based on the user mentions, such that their distances to each community strand are directly proportional to the amount of user mentions from that community.
lln14,4,community overview that shows all the communities within the selected dataset.
lln14,4,tag cloud that shows the keywords based on the focused event box.
lln14,4,The x coordinate of the user group is horizontally determined on a timeline (x-axis) based on the timestamps.
lln14,4,the keyword ‘‘Romney’’ is mentioned positively by the top community most of the time. However, a significant change occurred at 23:20 p.m., which shows a sudden mentioning from the bottom community. This mentioning was so negative that it dragged the keyword to the bottom side. When exploring all the active users inside the bottom user group, we found that most of the negative comments came from several active persons, who can be considered as abnormal users. Within the next 10 min, many people in the top community provided strong support for Romney, making the keyword turn back to the top with positive sentiment.
lln14,4,temporals segmentation and ranking. We segment the above raw data using a time window (e.g., every 30 min). Within each data segment, important users, keywords, and hashtags are ranked based on their occurrence count. Only the top active users and high frequency keywords (after removing the stop words) are kept for visualization.
lln14,4,Only the top active users and high frequency keywords (after removing the stop words) are kept for visualization.

scs19,1,Our work focuses on investigating reposting behaviors in social media. We focus on analyzing the diverse reposting cascades with multiple levels and different semantics
scs19,1,intuitive visual metaphors to enable users to explore different patterns.
scs19,1,A Visual Analytics System to Explore User Reposting Behaviors in Social Media.
scs19,1,allowing users to understand the reposting process from different perspectives.
scs19,1,utilizes visualization techniques to illustrate the diffusion process of information using a map metaphor
scs19,1,The goal of R-Map is to provide a scalable visualization method for a large scale reposting tree with multi-faceted information
scs19,1,The data in this study are taken from Sina Weibo, a social media platform like Twitter that is widely used in China.
scs19,1,Reposting Structure. Many users can participate in the reposting process, creating complicated tree structures
scs19,1,Key Players. Users have different roles in the reposting process. Key players have a strong influence on shaping the reposting tree structure and semantics
scs19,1,Different Behaviors. Repostings may have different semantics or temporal features. Here, we explore the features of reposting users as these may reveal the social mechanism underlying the process
scs19,1,Dynamic Diffusion. The life cycle of the dissemination of a weibo has multiple stages, including its beginning, bursting, and dying. At each stage, there are different reposting behaviors, topics and key players.
scs19,1,We investigate three types of relations in our analysis of reposting behaviors: follower-followee relations, key players’ reposting relations, and semantic relations
scs19,1,to organize information derived from the reposting tree, and link them with spatial objects such as continents, islands, countries, rivers, etc. The convenience of maps in terms of cognition means that people can better understand reposting data from multiple perspectives. Moreover, the spatialization of information in the map provides opportunities to visualize both the structure and the semantics at the same time.
scs19,1,Providing an overview of the reposting structure
scs19,1,Identifying users with different roles and behaviors
scs19,1,Revealing the dynamic diffusion process
scs19,1,R-Map provides an overview of the structure and the semantics for the diffusion of an original weibo
scs19,1,Users can interactively check the reposting relations of other nodes in the system
scs19,1,The Map View (Figure 5b) provides an overview of the reposting structure and the different topics discussed in the reposting process (R1). Rivers, bridges and routes explicitly indicate the different relations between key players. Each country is further divided into regions representing different topics.
scs19,1,F1 and F2 help users to compare the behaviors of different reposters, while F3 and F4 indicate the influence of reposters. F5 and F6 help users to understand the reason for the popularity of messages.
scs19,1,how our system can reveal the reposting process
scs19,1,to illustrate how key players can enlarge the influence of the source message and promote the evolution of topics
scs19,1,Most of the keywords are positive, and negative keywords are mostly shown on the territories associated with Kanchai. After fast-forwarding the diffusion process using the Timeline View, we divided the event into three stages
scs19,1,R-Map can intuitively reveal semantic features in the reposting process while showing the diffusion tree structure
scs19,1,which is color-coded by sentiment, gives us a sentiment overview of the reposting process and the opinions of weibo user
scs19,1,Zoom in and Explore Detailed Topics on Demand
scs19,1,The construction of R-Map takes into consideration both the reposting structure and the semantics,
scs19,1,R-Map provides intuitive map metaphors to help in the exploration of reposting data from the perspective of both structure and semantics.
scs19,1,provides an intuitive summary of the information reposting process.
scs19,2,a map metaphor
scs19,2,The important reposting behaviors, the following relations and the semantics relations are represented as rivers, routes and bridges, respectively, in a virtual geographical space
scs19,2,key players are visualized as lakes, and users reposting them become counties. Counties with similar topics form a region, while a lake and its surrounding counties form a country, which represents a subtree of the reposting tree. Connected countries form continents, and isolated islands represent messages that are different from the continents in topics. We use multiple connection symbols to represent different relations between key players. A river connecting lakes represents the reposting relations between key players. A route represents a reposting message that was not made by a follower, and a bridge represents a reposting message causing different repostings in semantics
scs19,2,we introduce R-Map, an interactive visualization with map symbols
scs19,2,A Novel Visual Metaphor Design for Information Reposting
scs19,2,Reposting features are mapped to different metaphors on the map, including lakes, counties, regions, countries, continents, islands, rivers, routes, and bridges
scs19,2,Lake: In the map, a lake represents a key player in the diffusion process.
scs19,2,Region, Country, Continent and Island, River, Route and Bridge
scs19,2,represent the parent-child relations of key players, thus showing the skeleton of the reposting tree
scs19,2,If a key player does not follow his/her parent, a curved route connects them; if the topics of the territories belonging to the key player are different from his/her parent, a straight bridge connects them
scs19,2,R-Map also uses two unique metaphors, bridges and routes.
scs19,2,We transform the reposting features into different map metaphors and construct a vivid map.
scs19,2,to organize information derived from the reposting tree, and link them with spatial objects such as continents, islands, countries, rivers, etc.
scs19,2,utilizes visualization techniques to illustrate the diffusion process of information using a map metaphor
scs19,2,Rivers, bridges and routes explicitly indicate the different relations between key players. Each country is further divided into regions representing different topics.
scs19,2,To highlight these special repostings for key players, we split the territories of key players from the continents in the form of islands
scs19,3,The root user is placed in the center of the country, and is distinguished from other nodes with an additional stroke. For other key players, they are placed on the boundary to show reposting relations
scs19,3,Counties with higher influence are highlighted with a black stroke
scs19,3,The position of a country is determined by a tree layout algorithm [18] and reveals the overall diffusion structure (R1)
scs19,3,Only the different relations among key players are highlighted,
scs19,3,we use color to encode the level information. The reposting levels are mapped to colors with the same hue but with monotonically increasing saturation values [42]. A green-scale color scheme is employed to make the map more intuitive and comprehensible. The darker the color of the polygon, the deeper it is within the reposting tree structure (R1). An alternative color scheme is also provided to represent the sentiment of each reposting: red, orange, and blue are used to represent negative, neutral and positive opinions, respectively (Figure 9)
scs19,3,Rivers, bridges, and routes are color-coded with blue, gray, and blue, respectively. To denote the boundaries of different countries, we use thick dark lines, and for regional boundaries, we use thinner gray lines to distinguish them from the country boundaries. The white space of the canvas is color-coded with light blue, similar to the color of the ocean. To enable a better understanding of the semantics in the diffusion process, keywords are overlapped on the map with color indicating different sentiments
scs19,3,each key node should be allocated a certain area,
scs19,3,we calculate the positions of the remaining nodes in the reposting trees.
scs19,3,We have allocated a different number of polygons to each key player.
scs19,3,Repostings without comments are located around the key players. Important counties are highlighted in each region, and are accompanied by some darker areas, which are their descendant repostings
scs19,3,The size of each word denotes the frequency it appears in the selected weibos
scs19,3,By coloring the map with sentiments, we found that negative sentiments dominated counties in these islands.
scs19,3,There are few positive (blue) counties on the map, and most people expressed negative (red) opinions.
scs19,3,visualized on the map using different regions and colors
scs19,3,If a key player does not follow his/her parent, a curved route connects them; if the topics of the territories belonging to the key player are different from his/her parent, a straight bridge connects them
scs19,3,which is color-coded by sentiment, gives us a sentiment overview of the reposting process and the opinions of weibo user
scs19,4,a Word Cloud View, and a Timeline View to support the visual exploration of the reposting diffusion process
scs19,4,Word Cloud View
scs19,4,The Word Cloud View shows the keyword distribution of the selected weibos. The sentiment of each word is averaged by the sentiment of weibos containing the word.
scs19,4,The Word Cloud View is dynamically updated to show keywords of new messages when an animation of the diffusion process is played
scs19,4,Timeline View
scs19,4,The Timeline View (Figure 5c) provides a temporal overview of the diffusion process (R3). Above the timeline, a node-link diagram is provided to indicate the reposting relations of the key players, which are sorted according to the reposting time
scs19,4,The time ticks show the delay time of reposting from that of the original weibo
scs19,4,The diffusion structure can be visualized using various link metaphors, including rivers, routes and bridges

jtm11,4,circle packing
ljc18,0,After extracting a set of topics and representing the texts by vectors of topic weights, we aggregate the data into a data cube with the dimensions corresponding to the set of topics, the set of spatial locations (e.g., regions), and the time divided into suitable intervals according to the scale of the planned analysis.
ljc18,0,geolocated social media posts
ljc18,0,In this structure, three dimensions correspond to (1) semantic categories, or topics, (2) locations (which may be regions in space), and (3) times (which may be time intervals).
ljc18,0,geolocated Twitter data
ljc18,0,We assume that text semantics can be characterized using a finite set of topics (themes) of interest.
ljc18,0,We shall call this number topic weight.
ljc18,0,A topic is defined as a probability distribution over a given vocabulary, i.e., a set of keywords, where keywords with high probabilities represent the semantic content of the topic.
ljc18,0,Table 1 shows representative keywords of topics extracted from a dataset of tweets related to Brexit that were posted in Britain from March 2016 to October 2017.
ljc18,0,We therefore aggregate messages that not only have common hashtags but also have close times of posting.
ljc18,0,The temporal domain is partitioned into suitable intervals. It is desirable to define the intervals based on calendar units, such as months, weeks, or days, or, when a finer temporal granularity is needed, hours of the day.
ljc18,0,the location set consists of the important cites of Britain, and the time period is divided into weeks.
ljc18,0,The representation of the dimensions needs to reflect their inherent properties, particularly, the geographic arrangement of the locations and the linear ordering of the time intervals.
ljc18,0,The items shown in the projection are labeled, depending on their nature, with the location names, indexes of time steps, or dominant keywords (i.e., having the highest weights for the topics).
ljc18,1,Analysis of Texts in Space and Time
ljc18,1,We propose an approach to analyzing data in which texts are associated with spatial and temporal references with the aim to understand how the text semantics vary over space and time.
ljc18,1,we systematically describe the space of analysis tasks on exploring the interrelationships among the three heterogeneous information facets, semantics, space, and time.
ljc18,1,To understand how the text semantics varies over space and time, one needs to explore the complex and diverse relationships between the three heterogeneous information facets.
ljc18,1,The first is how to construct the cube, in particular, how to represent text semantics in a summarized way suitable for being used as one of the cube dimensions. The second problem is how to utilize the cube structure and take advantage of it for supporting visual exploration of the data.
ljc18,1,A common way to summarize text semantics is probabilistic topic modeling.
ljc18,1,A location card is meant for comparing data at one location, called current location, with data at the other locations.
ljc18,2,Semantics-Space-Time Cube
ljc18,2,Each cube cell corresponds to a combination (topic, location, time interval)
ljc18,2,DATA cube is a widely used metaphor representing organization of data along some dimensions of interest.
ljc18,2,We introduce the operations of projecting and slicing the cube, which are used to decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks.
ljc18,2,we introduce a structure called Semantics-Space-Time Cube, or SSTC.
ljc18,2,we, first, consistently utilize the SSTC metaphor and concepts of projection and slice.
ljc18,2,A workflow for analyzing text-space-time data.
ljc18,2,Use of a cube metaphor for organizing data, defining the system of exploratory tasks, and designing the user interface and interactive operations.
ljc18,2,Relationship Explorer
ljc18,2,Correspondingly, the spatial view includes multiple linearly arranged cards, which contain geographic maps to reflect the specific of the spatial facet.
ljc18,2,This inherent feature is reflected in representing data by continuous curves or shapes, which is unique for the temporal view.
ljc18,2,Visual design of (a) location card and (b) topic card.
ljc18,2,The panels correspond to the three dimensions of the cube.
ljc18,2,A location card is meant for comparing data at one location, called current location, with data at the other locations.
ljc18,2,In the map, the graduated circles represent the counts of documents posted at the respective locations in comparison to the current location
ljc18,2,The bars representing the same selected item in consecutive cards are connected to form a continuous stream.
ljc18,2,This representation follows the idea of the ThemeRiver display.
ljc18,3,The use of colors, fonts, labeling, highlighting, and other kinds of visual marks and variables need to be consistent between the views.
ljc18,3,The card labels are colored according to the positions of the respective location and topic in the projection in the Data Selector.
ljc18,3,In the Relationship Explorer, we consistently use colors for representing the same data items in different views.
ljc18,3,we assign colors to objects according to their positions in a projection reflecting similarities between them.
ljc18,3,With this approach, color similarity indicates object similarity.
ljc18,3,using blue for lower values and pink for higher values.
ljc18,3,The current location is marked with a star symbol.
ljc18,3,The font sizes are proportional to the weights of the keywords for the topic.
ljc18,3,The bar colors correspond to the positions of the respective items.
ljc18,3,The information is shown in the form of word cloud with the font sizes proportional to the keyword weights.
ljc18,3,The bar heights are proportional to the respective popularity scores; the ordering from top to bottom corresponds to the decreasing order of the scores.
ljc18,4,We have to use several complementary views, and 2D representation is preferred over 3D. Based on these premises, we come to the necessity of using three views, spatial, temporal, and topical.
ljc18,4,The main component of a topic card is a word cloud composed on the topic-related keywords.
ljc18,4,The information is shown in the form of word cloud with the font sizes proportional to the keyword weights.
ljc18,4,In the initial (compact) mode (Fig. 8a), the cards contain multiple vertically arranged bars, which may correspond to topics or locations.
ljc18,4,The temporal domain is partitioned into suitable intervals. It is desirable to define the intervals based on calendar units, such as months, weeks, or days, or, when a finer temporal granularity is needed, hours of the day.
ljc18,4,we must use a combination of partial views, which, in principle, may be 2D or 3D.
lgx16,0,brand perceptions on social media
lgx16,0,two brands “Disney” and “Boeing”, each illustrates a brand’s perceived personality (in 5 broad traits or 42 subtraits) with visual evidence and related details from three social media factors.
lgx16,0,the similarities and differences of two brands in their perceived personalities and topic discussions on social media.
lgx16,0,While social media has demonstrated a huge potential to shape public perceptions of brands, existing tools are not intuitive and explanatory for domain users to use as they fail to provide a comprehensive analysis framework for perceptions of brands.
lgx16,0,brand personality framework in marketing literature and social computing approaches to compute the personality of brands from three driving factors (user imagery, employee imagery, and official announcement) on social media
lgx16,0,to assess brand personality from three driving factors of user imagery, employee imagery and official announcement on social media, and construct an evidence data explaining the association between brand personality and its driving factors.
lgx16,0,Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication and Ruggedness
lgx16,0,User Imagery are human characteristics associated with a brand’s typical users. Employee Imagery are human characteristics associated with the employees of a company.
lgx16,0,The data collection and preprocessing module collects and stores the online social media text documents such as tweets, online reviews, and user profiles to account for three facets of linguistic footprints that drive perceptions of brand personality on social media.
lgx16,0,For each brand, we collected its followers’ self-description on Twitter, which is a short description in a follower’s public profile. Overall, we obtained 1,996,214 brand follower descriptions
lgx16,0,The reviews often contain statements about working conditions, company culture and management styles, which are used to describe Employee Imagery. We collected 312,400 Glassdoor employee reviews in total.
lgx16,0,We considered the tweets from a brand’s Twitter account as its Official Announcements, and collected 680,056 tweets all together.
lgx16,1,visually summarize the distribution of brands over personality traits and the clusters of brands
lgx16,1,a novel visual analysis tool for brand managers to understand public perceptions of brands on social media.
lgx16,1,one important task for brand managers is to assess the perceived brand personality in their daily practice.
lgx16,1,A visualization design that conveys an integrated sense of multi-dimensional brand personality with visual evidence and related details.
lgx16,1,A visualization design that enables a contextual understanding of the marketplace of many brands.
lgx16,1,It facilitates perception based market segmentation through visual summarization of the distribution of brands over different personality dimensions and the clusters of brands.
lgx16,1,to understand consumer behavior as consumers’ beliefs, feelings and emotions can be inferred from what they say.
lgx16,1,The identification and analysis of varying effects of factors on different personality traits are crucial for them to make corresponding strategic decisions on a specific social media platform.
lgx16,1,Visual Analysis of Brand Comparison.
lgx16,1,a visualization system should offer comparative analysis of two brands in terms of how similar or different their brand personality is and what the driving factors are to lead such similarity or difference.
lgx16,1,Visual Aggregation and Summarization
lgx16,1,The overview should present a contextual understanding of the marketplace of many brands by providing summarization information such as the distribution of brands over different trait dimensions and the clusters of brands.

lgx16,2,The BrandWheels
lgx16,2,The Comparative BrandWheel
lgx16,2,BrandSediments
lgx16,2,BrandWheel visualization
lgx16,2,(1) multiple BrandSediments for visual aggregation of multi dimensional brand personalities,
lgx16,2,we design the BrandWheel visualization to illustrate a brand’s personality profile and its association with social media factors.
lgx16,2,Personality Sectors
lgx16,2,The wheel metaphor, inspired by both classic Radial Space Filling (RSF) technique and the beauty of Goethe’s color wheel, has several benefits compared with a traditional bar chart: the wheel metaphor with radial sectors conveys a representative sense of a brand’s personality, and lower memory cost with the metaphor from real life; it is also aesthetically more appealing and engaging than a bar chart.
lgx16,2,In analogy to the Goethe’s color wheel, each personality sector represents one personality trait, and multiple sectors in an RSF layout illustrate a brand’s personality profile with a set of personality traits.
lgx16,2,To balance aesthetics and functionality, curved wheel sectors are used to achieve the visual appearance of Goethe’s color wheel.
lgx16,2,Factor Bands
lgx16,2,Surrounding the personality sectors, factor bands are shown in the outer component of a BrandWheel in an RSF layout.
lgx16,2,A jigsaw of Goethe’s color wheel. A visual metaphor of personality wheel inspired from. The visual metaphor of BrandWheel, composed of personality sectors (illustrating personality traits) and factor bands (showing linguistic evidence from social media factors).
lgx16,2,factor bands include the linguistic evidence used to derived the traits from the social media factors in our data model.
lgx16,2,The most popular topics (i.e., salient semantic features in the evidence network) are visualized in topic blocks, which are tiled by word bricks of the representative words in an RSF layout.
lgx16,2,we extend the BrandWheel design and create Comparative BrandWheel by highlighting the similarities and differences of two brands’ personality profiles with representative topical words.
lgx16,2,To visualize the similarities and differences of the topical words of two brands (denoted as A and B), the word bricks of two brands in each factor band are grouped into three topic blocks based on their logical relations.
lgx16,2,we design the BrandSediments visualization using a sedimentation metaphor.
lgx16,2,This metaphor is inspired by real-world sedimentation processes where objects aggregate into strata over time.
lgx16,2,Each bubble in BrandSediments represents a brand.
lgx16,3,Following the design of Goethe’s color wheel, the trait type is mapped to the color of a personality sector and the radius 'Rt' of a personality sector encodes the trait value: the higher a trait value is, the farther a sector spreads out.
lgx16,3,The BrandWheel visualization with a focus on the Ruggedness trait: the User-factor-band gets closer to the view center than the other two, indicating a higher contribution in perceiving Ruggedness; the closeness of topic blocks towards the center also indicates their specific relevance to Ruggedness.
lgx16,3,a topic block (with respect to the inner boundary of the belonging factor band) depicts the weight of the corresponding topic regarding a particular trait; the color intensity of a word brick encodes the frequency of the word in the underlying linguistic documents.
lgx16,3,To show the popularity of words in the related topics, the color intensity Iw of a word brick encodes the frequency of the word in the underlying linguistic documents.
lgx16,3,Two distinct colors are mapped to the two underlying brands.
lgx16,3,The colors of bubbles reflect their personality traits, which are consistent with the colors used in the BrandWheel visualization.
lgx16,3,The size of a bubble encodes brand singularity, which measures the degree of focus and single-mindedness of a brand’s overall personality scales.
lgx16,3,the horizontal position of a bubble depicts the trait value of the corresponding brand, and brands of similar trait values are aggregated vertically to form a personality-based market segment within a trait value interval.
lgx16,4,MDS embedding of brand perceptions
lgx16,4,(1) multiple BrandSediments for visual aggregation of multi dimensional brand personalities, (2) a list view of brands with search and filter widgets, and (3) a multidimensional scaling (MDS) view that embeds brands based on their overall personalities
lgx16,4,A group of related brands identified as financial firms in the MDS view.
lgx16,4,Each bubble in BrandSediments represents a brand.
lgx16,4,it is also aesthetically more appealing and engaging than a bar chart.
csl12,0,Twitter regarding a recent 6.8 magnitude earthquake and a series of aftershocks and tsunamis that hit the northern coast of Hokkaido island
csl12,0,we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout.
csl12,0,A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process.
csl12,0,opinion leaders refer to a small minority of people who bridge media and common users and determine the ways (positive/ negative, fast/slow, and far/near) in which information is propagated.
csl12,0,tweets are visually classified into two categories, the tweets from media broadcasters and opinion leaders, and the tweets from other users.

csl12,1,tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time.
csl12,1,the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest.
csl12,1,fulfill the need for tracing information diffusion processes in social media, in a real time manner.
csl12,1,A dynamic diffusion series is used to highlight the key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process.
csl12,1,The collective responses to a given topic are summarized through the flow of retweets (represented as diffusion pathways).
csl12,1,Original tweets or retweets that initiate significant amount of retweets can be observed through the density of tweets around the center, the density of diffusion pathways and the focused diffusion series, which help identify the opinion leaders in a multistep information flow.
csl12,1,Temporal heterogeneity: The density and orientation of moving retweet glyphs capture whether a given topic is a short burst or a long-lasting trend, and whether the burst or trend differs for different communities.
csl12,1,To enhance visual pattern comparison, a visualization should encode key information into structurally organized component features which can be easily identified across multiple patterns.
csl12,1,Role identification: When tracing information diffusion in social media, it is crucial to identify key roles such as opinion leaders. It has been recognized that opinion leaders play decisive roles in the spread of information.
csl12,1,To facilitate an intuitive understanding about in formation diffusion,
csl12,1,makes it easy for users to grasp the visual narrative of the information diffusion and enables an immediate comparison without spending much effort learning the meaning of each component.
csl12,1,Therefore, representing opinion leaders and the information spread by them is crucial for tracing information diffusion in social media.
csl12,1,Each pathway is also a timeline whose time span is configurable to enable an exploration of the diffusion processes occurring between two chosen points in time.
csl12,1,Visualization about a diffusion process should have both dynamic updating to support realtime monitoring and temporal exploration to support backward scrutinization of historical patterns.
csl12,1,to explore the historical data and to support in-depth visual analysis.

csl12,1,how Whisper facilitates the exploration of people’s reactions and the temporal and spatial diffusion patterns.
csl12,1,intuitively represents the collective response, multi-step information flow as well as temporal heterogeneity of typical information diffusion processes.
csl12,2,original tweets are placed at the center of a circle and pathways are created to connect to geo-groups once the tweets got re-broadcasted (retweeted) by the groups.
csl12,2,The retweeting activity is shown as a sequence of color-coded retweet glyphs moving along pathways indicating the timing and sentiments of the retweets.
csl12,2,spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away
csl12,2,We visualize such social, spatiotemporal processes based on the metaphor of a “sunflower” whose seeds are often dispersed far away.
csl12,2,visual ingredients: a hierarchical social-spatial layout, the pathways of information flow, and a dynamic diffusion series.
csl12,2,original tweets are placed inside a circle in the center. A pathway is created to connect a tweet to a user community once it gets retweeted by that community.
csl12,2,we design Whisper based on the metaphor of a sunflower and how its seeds are carried and dispersed, where the key components within Whisper visualization are visually analogous to the functional parts of a sunflower.
csl12,2,The metaphorical pattern of a sunflower
csl12,2,The overall design is based on a metaphor of a sunflower. The bloom of the sunflower is composed of thousands of disc florets inside a circular head, surrounded by ray floret.
csl12,2,In analogy, the dots in the center in place of the sunflower disc florets represent tweets about topics of interests.
csl12,2,The lines forming the shapes of the sunflower ray floret represent the diffusion pathways, tracing the path from the information source tweet to different groups of users who rebroadcast (retweet) the tweet.
csl12,2,user groups are represented by cluster icons at the end of the ray florets.
csl12,2,The topic disc is analogous to the central circular head of a sunflower. The immature disk florets are in the very center of the circular head, surrounded by mature disk florets.
csl12,2,the dots packed in the center represent in active tweets that have never been retweeted and the dots surrounding the topic disc are the active tweets that have been retweeted within a given period of time.
csl12,2,A tweet is moved from the center to the outside ring when it gets retweeted for the first time.
csl12,2,The groups can be evenly laid out on a circle
csl12,2,The path linking a tweet to the retweet user groups illustrates a diffusion path along which the information of the tweet is diffused based on retweeting.
csl12,2,Diffusion pathways are traced as curved lines to reduce crossings and overlaps, which also mimic the shape of ray florets.
csl12,2,The first case can be indicated by a set of widespread curved pathways, and the second case is indicated by a small and concentrated set of pathways.
csl12,2,Particularly, the mature/immature disc florets are used to represent active/inactive tweets about a given topic. The ray floret are used to represent diffusion pathways that portray how the information diffused from the information sources at center to the surrounding user groups.
csl12,3,A sequence of color-coded retweet glyphs moving along the pathways indicates the timing and sentiments of the retweets
csl12,3,the node sizes of communities, with colors indicating the aggregated sentiments of the communities.
csl12,3,The groups can be evenly laid out on a circle or placed into positions corresponding to their geo-locations(latitude or longitude coordinates).
csl12,3,Color hue is used to encode sentiments. Three pre-selected colors, red, orange, and green, are used to represent negative, neutral, and positive opinions respectively.
csl12,3,Opacity is used to encode activeness. The activeness of a tweet is defined by how frequently it has been retweeted.
csl12,3,Size is used to encode expected influence. The expected influence of a tweet is given by the expected influence of the tweet user, which is defined by the number of followers the user has.
csl12,3,Shape is used to encode user types.
csl12,3,A square glyph indicates the tweet user has been recognized as a media outlet, journalist, or organization representative.
csl12,3,A round glyph tweet indicates the user does not belong to any of these categories.
csl12,3,Retweets are shown as arrow shape glyphs, with arrows pointing to user groups.
csl12,4,Whispertraced this event in real time.
csl12,4,the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest.
csl12,4,we utilize the geographical information to group users into geo-communities.
csl12,4,(1) the dynamic view shows the tweets and retweets generated in real time, which helps capture what is happening about the topic of interest; (2) the static view with timeline control enables users to explore the historical data and to support in-depth visual analysis.
csl12,4,Whisper supports temporal exploration in multiple ways. The timeline control allows users to slide back and forth to explore data within different time windows in the history. Users can also specify the time duration for retweets to be shown on both the diffusion pathways and on the diffusion series – a shorter time span allows a focus view on bursty topics.
csl12,4,the interactive timeline that summarizes the volume of incoming tweets and the average sentiments within each time interval; and 8) the diffusion series on which the detailed retweeting behaviors of users are visualized.

yfs10,0,hotel customers sharing their opinions
yfs10,0,online hotel customer reviews
yfs10,0,The system is built on a new visualization-centric opinion mining technique that considers uncertainty for faithfully modeling and analyzing customer opinions
yfs10,0,Aside from data on hotel customer feedback
yfs10,0,OpinionSeer could also be applied to visually analyze customer opinions on other products or services.
yfs10,0,we focus on the visual analysis of online hotel customer
yfs10,0,First, collected opinion data are high-dimensional and heterogeneous data with structured category dimensions and unstructured review comments, posing a challenge to analysis and visualization.
yfs10,0,Thus, hotel customer reviews from TripAdvisor are selected as our data samples for our system. The data we obtained from TripAdvisor can be divided into three parts: hotel data, customer data, and review data the review data include review information such as detailed free-text comments and the review sentiments estimated by our approach.
yfs10,0,The input of the system is a set of online customer reviews from TripAdvisor.com.
yfs10,0,It accounts for the ambiguity of human language when analyzing the sentiments of the customer reviews. Thus, in addition to general positive and negative values, the extracted opinions also explicitly contain the uncertainty values to indicate the amount of ambiguous information.
yfs10,0,The collected customer reviews contain customer ratings about the hotels.
yfs10,0,Every extracted opinion contains positive, negative, and uncertainty scores for each feature.
yfs10,0,When conveying opinions to a user, we usually need to combine multiple selected opinions for multi-scale visual data exploration
yfs10,0,Customer opinions are the center of customer feedback data,
yfs10,1,To provide multiple-level exploration, we introduce subjective logic to handle and organize subjective opinions with degrees of uncertainty. Several case studies illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of OpinionSeer on analyzing relationships among multiple data dimensions and comparing opinions of different groups.
yfs10,1,OpinionSeer could also be applied to visually analyze customer opinions on other products or services.
yfs10,1,We design and develop OpinionSeer to address the need to effectively communicate opinion-mining results and facilitate the analytical reasoning process. In the system, we use a new feature-based opinion mining technique to faithfully model the uncertainty in the review text.
yfs10,1,Hospitality researchers can use it as a general analysis tool to analyze and detect hidden patterns in raw text data, and provide a user-friendly visual presentation to end users such as hotel managers. For hotel managers, the system allows them to identify useful and meaningful relationships quickly among vast amounts of textual data uploaded by customers on the e-channel, so that an effective decision can be better formulated to give timely and appropriate responses to the customers.
yfs10,1,OpinionSeer could be applied to the visual analysis of customer opinions on other products or services
yfs10,1,We combine an opinion mining technique with subjective logic to model uncertainty in opinions and fuse the opinions.
yfs10,1,We design a new visual representation for customer feedback data to naturally encode the uncertainty information.
yfs10,1,How is the deviation of a group of opinions from the average?
yfs10,1,How could several groups of opinions be compared effectively?
yfs10,1,What are the differences in the cultural background of two groups of customers who hold similar or different opinions?
yfs10,1,Are there any localization or geography patterns regarding user opinions on a hotel or a certain group of hotels?
yfs10,1,Are there any temporal patterns regarding the users opinions?
yfs10,1,The free-text comments of reviews, on the other hand, are more informative (e.g., reasons for the opinions) than the ratings, providing concrete and descriptive information about customer opinions.
yfs10,1,To analyze customer opinions from different aspects, hotel managers and hospitality researchers usually need to classify customer reviews into different categories (or features) such as service, space, and cleanliness [1, 2, 19]. Thus, we use a feature-based opinion mining method [12, 23] to extract opinions from the customer reviews. It works as follows.
yfs10,1,To assist users in visually analyzing the complex opinion data effectively,
yfs10,1,to help user examine the real reason of a certain opinion as well as to compare customer reviews.
yfs10,1,Our design principles include effectiveness, intuitiveness, and attraction. Simplicity or intuitiveness is strongly required because our end users do not have much background on information technology, while the visualization should be aesthetically appealing because the users want to present their findings directly to a wider audience.
yfs10,1,By working closely with our target users, we developed a visualization system that could convey the results of the opinion mining, from simple to complex, while keeping its intuitiveness.
yfs10,1,The relationships could be revealed by connecting related categories using curved belts rather than parallelograms in
 Parallel Sets.
yfs10,1,By comparing these opinion points inside the opinion triangle, we could readily identify the differences of the customer opinion groups.
yfs10,2,OpinionSeer, an interactive visualization system that could visually analyze a large collection of online hotel customer reviews
yfs10,2,we developed an opinion visualization system that includes the opinion wheel, the tag cloud spreadsheet, and a set of tailored user interactions.
yfs10,2,The opinion wheel seamlessly integrates a scatterplot (opinion triangle) with a radial visualization (opinion ring). The opinion triangle is primarily used for visualizing the extracted opinions, each of which is an opinion vector (b,d,u) with three elements: negative, positive, and uncertainty values.
yfs10,2,a diagram of tag clouds is synchronized with the opinion wheel.
yfs10,2,Opinion Wheel: Integrated Visualization of Customer Opinion Data
yfs10,2,The major visualization of OpinionSeer is an opinion
yfs10,2,Opinion Triangle
yfs10,2,Opinion Rings
yfs10,2,Compared with other visual metaphors, the opinion triangle could present the uncertainty information naturally;
yfs10,3,a strong negative opinion could be represented by a point toward the left disbelief vertex of the opinion triangle.
yfs10,3,Similarly, an opinion with a high degree of uncertainty could be represented by a point toward the top uncertainty vertex of the opinion triangle.
yfs10,4,it is also a scatterplot familiar to and used frequently by our target users
yfs10,4,In this section, we introduce our adapted visualization approach based on scatterplots, glyphs, and radial visualization layouts to facilitate this task.
yfs10,4,The temporal rings can be configured to different styles showing temporal information at different levels of detail based on user requirements, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a)
yfs10,4,Fig. 1(b) shows the temporal ring and geographic ring simultaneously in the opinion wheel.
whws12,0,In this article we present a visual analytics system for news streams which can bring multiple attributes of the news articles and the macro/micro relations between news streams and keywords into one coherent analytical context, all the while conveying the dynamic natures of news streams.
whws12,0,a 1.5 gigabyte corpus of 333,289 news articles published between 2004 and 2006, with an interesting pedigree
whws12,0,Our TextWheel system consists of several visual components, which are all inspired by some everyday objects that users are very familiar with. For example, our keyword wheel is inspired by Ferris wheels. News articles move along the transportation belt just like baggage moving along the conveyor belt.
whws12,1,By observing the TextWheel and its content changes, some interesting patterns can be detected. We use our system to analyze several news corpora related to some major companies and the results demonstrate the high potential of our method.
whws12,1,there may exist complex macro/micro relations between keywords and articles. At the micro level, keywords (e.g., Bill Gates and Microsoft) have various relations. At the macro level, text articles may be also related (e.g., dealing with the same topic). Meanwhile, each article contains multiple keywords and each keyword likely appears in many articles; these relations may change with time.
whws12,1,text data can be extremely large and this poses special challenges for the scalability of visual encoding schemes
whws12,1,We focus on the multiple attributes of news articles and the dynamic relations between articles and keywords.
whws12,2,We introduce a new visualization primitive called TextWheel which consists of one or multiple keyword wheels, a document transportation belt, and a dynamic system which connects the wheels and belt.
whws12,2,To deal with the complex macro/micro relations existing among keywords and articles, we introduce a novel visual primitive called TextWheel which consists of one or multiple keyword wheels, a document transportation belt, and chains to connect the belt and wheels
whws12,3,Usually, the font size of a keyword represents the frequency of the keyword appearing in a document. We adopt this scheme in our system.
whws12,3,The color of the glyph encodes the average sentiment expressed in an article
whws12,3,The documents can come into the transportation belt with different orders. By default, they are arranged by time.
whws12,3,Keywords will be uniformly positioned in the circular frame of the keyword wheel.
whws12,3,The size of the wheel and belt, the order of the documents in the belt, and the encoding schemes are all configurable.
whws12,4,news streams are time-varying high-dimensional data
whws12,4,all the sentiment and word frequency information is collected and summarized as a line chart, which we call the significance trend chart, to provide an overview of the sentiment evolution over time

jsm16,1,we want to compose a meaningful timeline that threads all the representative shots to create an overview of the video plot in the specified time windows.
jsm16,1,Interactive Visual Summarization of Video Streams
jsm16,1,A visual summary of the video should preserve important contents based on viewers’ interests. It should contain sufficient information from both the video itself and the audience to support further pattern and climax analysis.
jsm16,1,In other words, this requires the visualization to process danmu posts (texts) and video frames (images) collectively.
jsm16,1,An effective video summary should reveal the main plot of the video so that users can grasp the storyline at a glance.
jsm16,1,This requires not only extracting proper representative frames from the video but also capturing the innate relationship among these frames, which can be a challenging task.
jsm16,1,The visualization should highlight viewerspoints of interest and enable a quick climax detection.
jsm16,1,This requires understanding of individual danmu post and lever aging the meta-information derived from aggregated danmu data.
jsm16,1,The system should enable flexible video exploration guiding by the aforementioned con textual information derived from the danmu data.
