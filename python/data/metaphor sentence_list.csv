"CrystalChat: Visualizing Personal Chat History Abstract As more people take part in online conversations, awareness of the varying conversational styles and social mores afforded by different software,is g,""rowing.,"",",,,,
"However, this awareness is largely built on personal impressions as varying styles of social interactions are hard to discover in text-based presentations.",,,,
Through visualization we explore social and temporal interactions in instant messaging.,,,,
CrystalChat visualizes personal chat history.,,,,
"Rather than showing online social networks that indicate merely who talks to who, CrystalChat reveals the patterns in an individual's communications with those people who are part of their personal,chat,history.,"",""",,,,
"The patterns revealed come from instant messaging data that includes information about temporal clustering, conversation initiation, conversation termination, length of conversations, length of post,""ings,"",patterns,""of repetitive or alternating postings, and emotional tone as represented by emoticons.,""",,,,
"face-to-face conversations; thus, visuals are added to augment the communication itself [11,15,18].",,,,
"Another reason to use visuals is to provide ways to better understand people's interactions and the social networks that develop around them [7,10,11,21].",,,,
"CrystalChat, an interactive visual representation of instant messaging data, falls into this latter category.",,,,
1,,,,
"Introduction While casual conversations are typically fleeting and traditionally leave no record, they have been and continue to be a significant part of our day to day interactions.",,,,
"Some varieties of online communication tools, such as instant messaging (IM), seem particularly well suited for casual conversations where people use single words, sentence snippets and complete eac,h oth,er's phr,""ases.,""",,,,
"Unlike the spoken variety of these communications, the online version leaves a digital trace.",,,,
"We present CrystalChat, a visualization of the trace information left by instant messaging.",,,,
"Online communication continues to grow in the number of people who use it, in the number of messages sent, and in the new varieties and styles of software that support it.",,,,
"Online communication now includes not only email but also things such as chatrooms, bulletinboards, text messaging, conferencing software, newsgroups, and instant messaging.",,,,
"This is changing the way we communicate with each other and affecting the way we maintain our social groupings [2,3,6].",,,,
Accompanying visuals have arisen to support these tools.,,,,
"One reason for visualizing this data is that simple text communication is less rich than Text data from IM chat is typically displayed as a temporally ordered list and quickly fills available screen,spac,""e.,"",",,,,
"As a result, we can only view a small segment at a time and the text list itself does not make interaction patterns easy to discern.",,,,
A considerable number of social visualizations have arisen in response.,,,,
"These often focus on a particular type of online communication such as email [10, 19] and newsgroups [2] or a particular aspect of the data such as the social network [5-7,13] and conversation initi,ation,and resp,""onse [10,17].,""",,,,
"These social visualizations are created to enrich text and to visually capture social patterns that are not easily visible through plain text [28,13,15,17-21].",,,,
"CrystalChat focuses on the social interaction centered around one person, supporting selfexploration of one's own chat history (Figure 1).",,,,
This program creates an interactive visualization that incorporates the actual text messages in a structure that \x0cintegrates one's chat interaction patterns with a temporal trace of history.,,,,
Our design is based on combining the social network and the temporal aspect into one 3D representational structure.,,,,
In the next section we outline the related work.,,,,
"In Section 3, we describe the concepts and design goals behind CrystalChat.",,,,
"In Section 4, we explain the visual representation and Section 5 discuss interaction possibilities.",,,,
"In Section 6, we describe some of the patterns revealed by this visualization.",,,,
"In Section 7, we discuss response from people who have used CrystalChat.",,,,
In Section 8 we discuss and list future work.,,,,
We conclude in Section 9.,,,,

Related Work Visualizing online conversations has been approached from many perspectives.,,,,
"These include visually augmenting the chat itself, visualizing the social networks formed by chat activities, and providing some trace of activities through time.",,,,
"Most chat spaces are primarily text-based, though some graphic symbols that represent each person are often included.",,,,
Comic Chat [11] augments text space by providing tools to support the use of some aspects of comics such as word balloons and comic characters.,,,,
Each person is represented by a comic character allowing for the use of simple expressions and gestures.,,,,
"This augmentation requires effort on the part of the user and, while this presentation is charming, most people still opt for the simplicity and speed of text entry.",,,,
Chat Circles [19] provide an abstract visual system in which the chat takes place.,,,,
Each individual is represented as a circle which expands to hold a message's text.,,,,
"In order to ?쁥ear??or see the words of another's posting, your circle must be close to theirs.",,,,
Your next posting replaces the previous one.,,,,
"Social groupings form and adjust spatially, indicating who is listening to whom.",,,,
"There are many other similar systems developed in the MIT Lab that also visualize the social patterns of a group of people [2,3,21].",,,,
"Here, the social information from one person is present but gets lost in many cases when the visualization is based on and/or focuses on the entire social community.",,,,
Visualizations of the social network of online communication often use some form of graph structure in which the nodes represent the people and edges represent the relationships between people.,,,,
Mutton [14] describes a system that uses a bot to infer a social network which is then displayed as a node and weighted edge diagram.,,,,
The edge weights represent the relative strength of the relationships and a spring layout is used to display the graph.,,,,
Our previous work [16] showed the social network with translucent directed edges.,,,,
The relative weight of an edge builds with repeated communications.,,,,
Both of these works show the communication network between people.,,,,
"In contrast, Thread Arcs [10] shows the relations between email messages for one person.",,,,
PostHistory and Social Network Fragments (SNF) [20] are two visualizations that also focus on one person.,,,,
PostHistory displays one person's direct interactions with their email contacts.,,,,
SNF represents people by their name.,,,,
The type of relationship they have with the central person is indicated by color and the strength of their relationship is indicated by font size.,,,,
"Again, a spring layout is used.",,,,
"While both visualizations report that the central person found meaning in these representations, they can become complex and cluttered thus, hard to decipher.",,,,
"In CrystalChat, we focus on the social network revolving around one person, but support selective display of chosen subsets of this network.",,,,
"Time lines are used to represent patterns in data sets that have been produced for periods of time [5,9,15,20].",,,,
"These timelines make intervals, patterns, and repetitions of series of events more visible.",,,,
"For example, LifeLines [15] is a time line that visualizes personal histories.",,,,
This interface begins with one screen overview and then allows the user to focus on details upon request with rescaling and filtering tools provided.,,,,
"There are many visual systems that have considered social activity, social network, and the temporal aspect in one system.",,,,
"However, these components are either shown in separate screens or in two visualizations.",,,,
"For example, both Chat Circles [19] and Babble [5,8] have included visualizations of social activity and timeline, but in two separate visualizations.",,,,
Newsgroup Crowds and AuthorLines [18] also visualize the social group and the individual separately.,,,,
"The work that is most related to CrystalChat is a user-centric social interaction system, the side by side visualizations of PostHistory and SNF [20].",,,,
Their studies reveal that visualizing personal email habits supports personal narration and recall.,,,,
"However, people and time are again presented in the division of two panels and on separate screens.",,,,
"With multiple screens, the user would have to learn to relate the two graphical representations to see a pattern.",,,,
One can lose one's point of reference when switching from one visualization interface to another.,,,,
Mutton [14] provides minimal evidence of temporality by fading his graph layout as time passes.,,,,
As time progresses eventually old parts of the graph will disappear.,,,,
"On the other hand, CrystalChat is a visualization that combines the social network and the temporal aspect into one 3D structure.",,,,
"All the social information remains and does not disappear with time, so that people can go back in time to view the conversations history.",,,,
3,,,,
CrystalChat The intention behind CrystalChat is to visualize one's personal chat history.,,,,
Online social networks are complex structures often forming general graphs as the number of interconnections between people grows.,,,,
"In contrast, one's connections to those people who are part of one's personal chat history can be represented simply as a hub and spoke diagram.",,,,
"This hub and spoke diagram can be seen in Figure 2, where the hub ??here a void in the centre ??represents oneself and each spoke represents each person one chats with.",,,,
"However, there is more data in chat history than is evident in this view.",,,,
"This includes data about temporal clustering, conversation initiation, conversation termination, length of conversations, length of postings, patterns of repetitive or alternating postings, and emot,ional,tone as,""represented by emoticons.,""",,,,
"within the visualization, we extend these spokes into the third dimension.",,,,
"Figure 1 shows an aerial view (slightly offset from the top as seen in Figure 2) to reveal how the spokes representing the conversations with one person have become facets in which the temporal patt,erns,can be re,""vealed.,""",,,,
3.1.,,,,
"The design goals In order to visualize one's personal chat history in a single structure capable of revealing temporal patterns, we developed the following design goals: ??????????????To reveal one,pers,on's cha,""t activities using data available from chat log history.,""",,,,
To make individual messages apparent and maintain the link between the message's visual symbol and its text contents.,,,,
To indicate the beginning and ending of a ?쁟onversation??as defined by the opening and closing of a chat dialog box.,,,,
To represent one's interactions with each person as a distinct visual grouping in one's chat network.,,,,
To provide a structure linking the interactions with all people in one's chat network.,,,,
"To be able to show temporality, including both ordinallity which indicates sequencing as in which message is followed by which message, and frequency, to indicate the comparative length of time betw,een m,essages.,"",""",,,,
To provide an indication of the emotional content of the chat dialog as indicated by the emoticons used.,,,,
3.2.,,,,
The data One approach might be to assign as much of this data as possible to different visual variables [1] and draw the spoke edges accordingly.,,,,
This approach involves making use of the visual variables that have not been used in the basic diagram to characterize the spokes.,,,,
"Since location and orientation create the hub and spoke diagram this leaves visual variables such as colour, size, shape, (light and dark) value, and texture.",,,,
"For instance, characterizing the spokes according to some aspect such as posting frequency is of interest.",,,,
"To include as many details as possible about temporal patterning and to incorporate the actual text of the posting While CrystalChat currently uses history log data from MSN Messenger, the visualiza,tion,structure,""can easily be applied to other instant messaging systems.,""",,,,
The history log data develops as follows.,,,,
Chat messages are received in real time and these text messages are then stored in history log files that are ordered consecutively according to when the text message was received and written.,,,,
The log files are formatted as an xml ordered list (see Figure 3).,,,,
"This file contains data about the time the message was posted, the person who posted it, the person receiving it and the contents.",,,,
There is a file like this one for every different person with whom one chats.,,,,
This data format lends itself to revealing chat patterns between oneself and one other person.,,,,
Viewing two separate files make comparing conversations with more than one person difficult.,,,,
"Each message has a time stamp with the time, day, month and year.",,,,
Each message also includes a ?쏷o??and ?쏤rom?? which shows the user's friendly (nick) name.,,,,
The colour and type of fonts used in the original message are also included in this xml file.,,,,
The end of an individual message is indicated when a person hits the enter key or presses send.,,,,
The xml file also includes information on when the \x0c4.,,,,
"CrystalChat: the Approach In this section, we use illustrations to build up a description of the CrystalChat visual representation.",,,,
4.1.,,,,
Building a conversation from a sequence of messages When viewed from above each spoke represents all the conversations with one person.,,,,
"When viewed from the side, these spokes are revealed as flat facets containing all the details of the conversations with a single person.",,,,
"As shown in Figure 4, the conversations are temporally sequenced starting from the bottom so that the most recent conversation is always at the top.",,,,
"This order makes more sense when viewing from the top, since the most recent conversation is in front.",,,,
Each person in one's chat community has a facet in the crystal.,,,,
The number of facets represents the number of people that were chosen to be displayed.,,,,
All figures used for this explanation display six different people.,,,,
Figures 1 and 4 show some evidence of these multiple facets along the left hand side.,,,,
Each facet starts from the empty central hub and points outward like spokes in a wheel.,,,,
Figure 2 shows the top view of the six spokes.,,,,
The central open region is small but important for the readability of the individual facets.,,,,
"Starting the facets too close to each other can interfere with people's ability to maintain visual distinctions between the facets and, as a result, to comprehend where they are in their exploratio,""ns.,"",,",,,,
"Figure 5: The red arrow indicates the viewpoint, the blue triangle indicates the field of view and the red line indicates the transparent shield.",,,,
The facet in front of the transparent shield is the facet viewed in Figure 4.,,,,
The default view is to have a single facet approximately centered on the screen (Figure 4).,,,,
The view in Figure 4 shows one facet when viewed from between two facets.,,,,
This is shown diagrammatically as a top view in Figure 5 where the red arrow indicates the viewpoint and the blue triangle shows the field of view.,,,,
"From the diagram, one can see that several other facets would also be in the field \x0cof view.",,,,
"To clarify the view of the facet that is being examined, a translucent shield is placed directly behind it.",,,,
This is shown in Figure 5 by the red line.,,,,
This translucent plane placed behind the current facet increases readability and makes it possible to expand the number of facets displayed.,,,,
The translucent plane can also be used for the subtle display of additional information from the top view.,,,,
This is described in section 4.5.,,,,
4.2.,,,,
Building a facet from a sequence of conversations Each facet is composed of a series of conversations which are constructed as follows.,,,,
A colored disc represents a single message (Figure 6) and each colour indicates a different person (Figure 7).,,,,
"In these images, the person whose chat network is displayed is represented by a neutral colour grey so that all colour choices for other people will show well in contrast.",,,,
Left to right reading sequencing is used to order these messages.,,,,
"That is, the messages are arranged so that the first message in the conversation starts on the left.",,,,
"A conversation is defined, as in the data, by the opening and closing of the chat window.",,,,
One row of message discs represents a conversation (Figure 8).,,,,
Figure 8: The row in CrystalChat represents the conversation that occurred within a given message window.,,,,
4.3.,,,,
"Including the text data in the visualization As declared in our design goals, all the text details are still connected with each message disc.",,,,
One can explore each of the conversations in detail by selecting it.,,,,
The conversation will open diagonally to maintain both the temporal ordering and to provide space for the text of each message to be displayed (Figure 9).,,,,
The colour of the text corresponds to the colour used to represent the person who sent the message.,,,,
Figure 9: The text of one conversation displayed.,,,,
4.4.,,,,
"Augmenting the basic structure Figure 6: As indicated in red, one circle represents one message in CrystalChat.",,,,
Figure 7: Colour is used to identify individual people.,,,,
CrystalChat is a fully interactive 3D hub and spoke structure.,,,,
The spokes extend into 3D as planes that we refer to as facets.,,,,
"With the structure as described at this point, the simple view from the top (Figure 10) does not provide much in the way of additional information.",,,,
It simply shows the number of facets available and is helpful in supporting the creation of a mental model of the structure as it is rotated.,,,,
"When viewing from the top, the discs automatically rotate, showing their flat side and making their colour visible (Figure 10).",,,,
"Within a facet, every time a conversation occurs, the conversation row is placed on top of the previous row like a stack.",,,,
"Thus, the varying sizes of the message circles in the perspective view from the top indicate the relative number of conversations in each facet.",,,,
All the illustrations thus far have shown the messages as temporally ordered and the conversations as ordered by start time.,,,,
Time has been considered as an ordered variable.,,,,
"To display more precise relative sequence information, the actual times of conversation posting can be included.",,,,
"In Figure 11, the gaps between messages represent the amount of time that occurred between the conversations.",,,,
"This mode of representation takes more space but does reveal the temporal interspacing of conversations between different people, thus providing relative time spacing.",,,,
The timeline is still vertical and increases upwards.,,,,
"In this view, when temporal data is used explicitly, each row of messages corresponds to the conversations in one day.",,,,
A greater distance occurring between two conversation rows means that more days have occurred in between those two conversations.,,,,
Figure 11: Temporal spacing.,,,,
"In the temporal spacing mode, there can be more than one conversation occurring in one day causing conversation rows to overlap.",,,,
"From both the side and top view, these overlapped conversation rows that occur in the same day can be fanned out like playing cards in a dealt hand (Figure 12).",,,,
"Using this feature, one can determine the amount of conversations that occurred during one particular day by seeing the number of conversation lines as they are fanned out.",,,,
Figure 12: Top view with temporal spacing - each facet is spread in a fan to see more than one conversation occurring in one day.,,,,
4.5.,,,,
Showing emoticon content We mentioned earlier that translucent planes were added for readability for the side view.,,,,
These planes slightly obscure the rest of the structure without removing one's awareness of it.,,,,
"Still using a subtle colour, the plane can be used to display information about conversational tone.",,,,
The use of emoticons and punctuations in messages are evident with the color change of the plane.,,,,
Figure 10: Top view ??one can approximate number of conversations that occurred with one person by comparing the sizes of the circle.,,,,
Consider the view from the top (Figure 13).,,,,
Here each corner of the translucent plane corresponds to one's conversations with a given person.,,,,
The hexagonal shape results from the choice to display one's conversations with six people.,,,,
"One can also move the translucent plane towards the viewer or away from the viewer, which has the effect of bringing into focus what is above and subduing what is below the plane.",,,,
This interactive repositioning of the translucent plane moves through one's chat history.,,,,
The neutral colour of the plane is pale yellow.,,,,
Moving the \x0cscreen up or down to a different level will also cause colour changes as the use of emoticons changes.,,,,
structure the camera paths allow the freedom wanted and provide the user with the feeling of simple control and understandable view transitions.,,,,
Figure 13: The colors of the translucent plane change according to the amount of emoticons used.,,,,
5,,,,
Interacting with CrystalChat There are several significant views for this 3D structure.,,,,
Camera paths and smooth animation are applied to move through different views of this wheel-like structure.,,,,
"In creating navigation interactions with CrystalChat, our purpose is not to limit the navigation power but to provide 3D interaction paths that give freedom without causing the viewer to lose themse,lves,in 3D scr,""een space.,""",,,,
Figure 14: Top view with no time filters applied.,,,,
"Setting camera paths is similar to setting pan, scroll and zoom paths in 2D spaces.",,,,
"For the side views, our 3D camera paths are set so that one can rotate forward or backward viewing the different facets in the structure.",,,,
"Further navigations include panning upwards, downwards, and side-to-side and zooming in and out.",,,,
"From the top view, the user can zoom in and zoom out, shifting forward and backwards through time.",,,,
"This provides a rich 3D structure that contains possibilities of visual comparisons between several conversations, within an easy to use navigation scheme that is a simple extension to 2D navigation,"".,"",,",,,,
"Switching from the side view to the top view or vice versa, the camera is animated automatically along a smooth camera path, guiding the viewing's eye to understand what is being done.",,,,
How this camera path is shaped and how fast the camera moves is also important.,,,,
"In general, we are familiar with the idea of moving through 3D space via camera paths through our experiences in movies.",,,,
This idea has been successfully used in interfaces such as a 3D desktop [12].,,,,
"While we have not formally studied this, people (including the authors) outright refused to use a version with total 3D freedom and happily use the camera path navigation without mentioning it as an,issu,""e.,"",",,,,
In this Figure 15: A time filtered selection.,,,,
There are also filtering features available.,,,,
More occlusion problems start occurring when looking from top view.,,,,
The filters allow users to filter conversations by selecting a certain time frame.,,,,
Figure 14 has no filters applied and Figure 15 is filtered for a specific time period.,,,,
"This way, different conversations from different people can be identified by their colours more easily.",,,,
6,,,,
Emerging Patterns With this visualization there are several patterns that became more visible in comparison to a simple text list.,,,,
"In Figure 16, one can see that the person with the green disc initializes the conversation more often.",,,,
The number and frequency of message posting varies for different people.,,,,
"From the visual pattern in Figure 17, we can see at a glance that the number of messages sent between the two people varies in that the person in grey sends more messages than the person in pink.",,,,
Note that the person in grey often sends a series of consecutive messages.,,,,
Figure 16: The person in green has started the majority of the conversations.,,,,
Figure 17: The number and frequency of message posting varies for different people.,,,,
"When the text view is expanded, colour coded letters show which person has sent longer messages (Figure 9).",,,,
The value of the colour changes to represent the length of the messages.,,,,
"For example, the darker the value means the longer the messages.",,,,
We use this term value to mean the relative lightness or darkness of a given hue by increasing or decreasing the RGB values.,,,,
"As shown in Figure 18, one can spot at a glance the more verbose conversations from those that consist of quicker word responses.",,,,
"Figure 18: The darker the color value of the message circle, the more characters that are typed for that message.",,,,
7,,,,
"Personal Response While CrystalChat has not been formally studied, this visualization has been distributed to several people and we received both positive and negative feedback.",,,,
"On the positive side, use of this tool prompts people to reminisce, telling stories about their personal history.",,,,
"For example, some people mentioned why they were talking a lot during a period of time and what they were talking about.",,,,
As mentioned in [20] this use is parallel to common use of photo albums.,,,,
People enjoy gathering around a set of pictures and hearing about the events that occurred when those pictures were taken.,,,,
"Similarly, viewing previous IM conversations triggered this type of story telling.",,,,
This is an interesting use for this type of tool.,,,,
"Previously, conversations were fleeting and often only hashed over in case of a disagreement.",,,,
"In contrast, this type of story telling was clearly pleasurable.",,,,
"Also, patterns confirm people's relationship with others.",,,,
"For instance, one person reflected how his personal relationship has changed in the past months as he was able to see the social pattern through the visualization that he did not have as many conver,satio,ns with h,""is friend any more.,""",,,,
"Even though CrystalChat currently does not show the name of the person they are talking to, people were able to identify who the person was by reading the conversation.",,,,
From this a person realized that she had longer conversations with women than she did with her male friends.,,,,
This program not only allowed people to discover their own personal patterns but also allowed them to reflect upon themselves and influenced them to change their social behavior in the future.,,,,
"A person uttered, ?쏧 don?셳 have as many conversations with this person anymore, and this is probably something I should do more often??",,,,
Another person realized the majority of the conversations that she initialized were mainly because she had a question about \x0csomething.,,,,
This gave her pause to consider whether this social pattern was something she would change.,,,,
"On the negative side, while people really did like the camera paths implemented, they wanted to do more navigation outside of these paths.",,,,
"For instance, zoom out further while still rotating the 3D structure.",,,,
"In this situation, because people could still navigate for themselves in 3D space, they sometimes got confused and at times, lost in 3D space.",,,,
We are currently working on extending the work with camera paths to provide all the 3D navigation that the structure requires.,,,,
"We need to study for this 3D structure, whether a set of camera paths is sufficient or whether a good set of paths plus free navigation with a method for easily returning to the path set may be pref,erred,"".,"",",,,,
"With real-time chat conversations, graphical representations can be overwhelming and can cause distractions when people are trying to pay more attention to typing and reading responses.",,,,
"However, viewing chat history is not a distraction as it is a tool intended for afterconversation use.",,,,
8,,,,
Discussion and Future Work There are certainly advantages and disadvantages to archiving conversations such as instant messaging.,,,,
"Lovejoy and Grudin [13] mention that ephemeral conversations, such as instant messaging, encourage casual and informal exchanges.",,,,
"However, once conversations are archived people tend to write more formally and less casually.",,,,
"This may be an issue, but if chat histories are used in an informal setting or if the system is set in a way where only the authors have viewing permission, it may not be a large problem.",,,,
"As mentioned earlier, CrystalChat is a user-centric system where only one's own conversations can be viewed.",,,,
"The general design structure of CrystalChat can be used with other types of messaging applications, but there are some limitations.",,,,
Cell phone text messaging might be appropriate because exchanged messages are generally short.,,,,
This could be applied to email but some decisions would have to be made.,,,,
"For instance a facet could represent an email thread or a facet could represent one person, each row representing one email and each circle representing a sentence or a word.",,,,
"However, the limitations would arise because the text in emails tends to be longer.",,,,
"Theoretically, this 3D structure can support a considerable amount of information.",,,,
Each conversation from a new day can be stacked on top of the ones from the day before.,,,,
Conversations also can be very long as there are no boundaries for the length of conversation rows.,,,,
"Technically speaking, however, computers can only store so much information before runtime response becomes unbearable.",,,,
Interaction with the system can become tedious as panning from the bottom to the top will take longer as the years of conversations increases.,,,,
"Similarly, reading long conversations by panning left and right can also be frustrating.",,,,
There are still many changes that need to be made to make this visualization more effective.,,,,
This visualization is structured such that new features can be added.,,,,
We also collected many suggestions for changes that people would like to have incorporated into the structure.,,,,
??Improve the general interactive capabilities to allow one to always focus on the 3D form rather than having to switch and look elsewhere.,,,,
??Include date labels for timeline integrated into the structure in a similar manner to which the text contents now are integrated.,,,,
??Add more camera paths to have a complete interaction set so that sorting out 3D navigation would be simple.,,,,
"??Incorporate more visual information into the size or shape of the message circles to represent word complexity, number of emoticons, number of punctuations, etc.",,,,
??Allow spokes of people to be rearranged around the hub 10.,,,,
"Conclusion CrystalChat visualizes one's personal social network, focusing on providing a single visual structure that is capable of revealing temporal interactivity and providing information about,the q,uantity a,""nd frequency of message posting.,""",,,,
It reveals one person's chat activities using data available from chat log history.,,,,
"With CrystalChat, individual messages are apparent and still linked to their textual content.",,,,
A given conversation can be opened at will.,,,,
Messages within a conversation are grouped and conversations are associated according to the person involved.,,,,
This structure also provides an indication of the emotional content of the chat dialog as indicated by the emoticons and punctuations used.,,,,
"Providing a graphical interface that represents conversation through an interesting graphical environment can encourage people to view their past conversations and examine their own social behavior.,"","",,",,,,
"While existing patterns emerge visually through effective social visualization, peoples??memories of the past can surface and storytelling can occur.",,,,
"Furthermore, personal social habits can be realized and can influence one's future social interaction.",,,,

1 I NTRODUCTION Social networks are constructs capturing interdependencies among the states and actions of seemingly autonomous social actors [3].,,,,
"The two principle aims in the study of social networks are understanding their formation (networks as consequences, dependent variables) and their effects (networks as antecedents, explanatory varia,bles),""[2].,"",",,,,
"For empirically observed associations between network structure and actor behavior, however, there are often competing explanations with opposite directions of causality.",,,,
"Longitudinal social network data, i.e., network data over time, are thus crucial to assess whether the social embedding of an actor in詮굑enced the actor's actions (social in詮굑ence), or whether a,n act,or's act,""ions prompted a change of relations (social selection).,""",,,,
"Visualization is an essential tool in both the exploration of social networks and the communication of 詮걆dings [20, 5, 12].",,,,
"While crosssectional network data pose many challenges already, longitudinal data increase the level of complexity signi詮갷antly [35].",,,,
"Because of this complexity and the multitude of interests that analysts may have, it is unlikely that there are general visualization schemes serving the majority of needs.",,,,
"Instead, social network visualizations should be tailored to the speci詮갷 type of data and analytical interest at hand.",,,,
"Here we are interested in such a speci詮갷 scenario, assuming a network of asymmetric relations and an interest in the evolution of dyadic (i.e., pairwise) relations along with their embedding in th,e str,ucture at,""large.,""",,,,
This scenario is rather typical for empirical studies of longitudinal social networks.,,,,

Section 3.1) ??the gestalt-based use of glyphs in sparklines [54] for multivariate sequences ??are integrated with a matrix representation of all dyads in the network.,,,,
"The resulting diagrams share the overall strengths and weaknesses of matrix representations [22], but in addition allow for the simultaneous representation of all evolving dyads in a single, static,image,suitable,""for print publication.,""",,,,
The remainder is organized as follows.,,,,
We start with some background on longitudinal social networks and their visualization in the next section.,,,,
The cornerstone of our approach is a static representation of the evolution of certain types of dyadic data and derived in Section 3.,,,,
"In Section 4, these elements are combined into a representation of entire longitudinal networks.",,,,
"The approach is illustrated by a case study on a well-researched data set presented in Section 5, and initial feedback from domain experts reported in Section 6.",,,,
We conclude with a brief discussion including directions for future work.,,,,
"2 BACKGROUND In this section, we delineate the scope of our method by spelling out in detail the type of data assumed and by reviewing related work on its visualization.",,,,
"2.1 Social Network Data The most common type of data in empirical social network studies consists of a set of actors such as individuals or organizations, and one or more types of relations between,them.,"","",",,,,
Examples are friendship networks among pupils and the trading of goods between nations.,,,,
Relations may be symmetric (as is often assumed in the former example) or asymmetric (as in the latter example).,,,,
"Often, relations are valued, i.e., a numerical value associated with each tie indicates a speci詮갷 quality of the relation.",,,,
"See [25, 34, 37] for background on social network data and data collection.",,,,
We here assume networks of a single valued asymmetric relation.,,,,
"These are modeled by an edge-weighted directed graph G = (V, E; d), consisting of a set of vertices V representing the actors, a set of directed edges E ??V 횞 V \\ {(v, v) : v ??V } representing th,e tie,""s, and a"",""real value d : E ??[0, M] in the range from zero to a maximum value M associated with each edge.,""",,,,
"We will use di j = d((i, j)) to denote the value associated with edge (i, j) ??E, and do not distinguish di j = 0 and (i, j) ??/ E. Note that we do not assume actor attributes, because their number,and t,ype is mu,""ch more application-speci詮갷.,""",,,,
Note also that the majority of empirical studies deals with networks of 10??00 actors.,,,,
2.2 Longitudinal Networks We have argued in the introduction that longitudinal data is essential in assessing causality.,,,,
"The addition of (forms of) time-variability, however, leads to a combinatorial explosion of data types and problems.",,,,
"Here, we assume panel data (waves of network observations rather than, e.g., dyadic events) on a 詮걒ed set of actors.",,,,
This is the standard scenario for the form of analysis that is most common in the social sciences and based on stochastic actor-oriented models [46].,,,,
"The data thus consists of a sequence of weighted directed graphs G1 = (V, E1 ; d 1 ), .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
", GT = (V, ET ; d T ) sharing the same vertex set V , but with potentially varying edge sets and edge weights.",,,,
"Typical values for T are in the range of 2??0 observations, with a bias toward the lower end.",,,,
"2.3 Network Visualization Traditional graphical representations of social networks are the common sociogram (node-link representations as in Figure 3(d)) and the less common sociomatrix (a matrix re,prese,ntation a,""s in Figure 7(a)).,""",,,,
See [36] for some of the earliest examples.,,,,
The crucial algorithmic challenges for node-link diagrams are placement of nodes and routing of edges.,,,,
"Such layout problems are the main focus in graph drawing [1, 31], where many fundamental techniques have been developed that can be adapted for speci詮갷 scenarios.",,,,
"Exemplary designs are proposed, e.g., in [7, 6, 43].",,,,
A subcategory of node-link diagrams is formed by attribute-based designs as exempli詮갻d in PivotGraphs [56].,,,,
"Similarly, the main algorithmic challenge for matrix representations is the ordering of rows and columns [13].",,,,
In combination with speci詮갷 interaction concepts they have re-gained some popularity in systems for exploring large network data such as [16].,,,,
A hybrid approach combining node-link diagrams and matrix representations for dense subgraphs is presented in [29].,,,,

2.4 Time-Varying Network Visualization A straightforward solution is the use of animation.,,,,
Since animation is a mapping of empirical time to display time it requires special media.,,,,
"For node-link representations, the layout problem is made more severe by the additional coherence constraints required to ensure smooth transitions between high-quality layouts of G1, .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
", GT .",,,,
"A common technique is the anchoring approach of [8, 21], and a review is given in [35].",,,,
"An alternative to plain animation is interaction, in which time and focus are chosen explicitly as in the matrix-based system of [59].",,,,
See also [50] for a systematic treatment of this approach.,,,,
"If dynamic media are not available or simultaneous cross-time comparisons are of importance, snapshots of an animation are often displayed in small multiples [53].",,,,
"The example in Figure 3 is based on an aggregation approach, in which all nodes remain in the same position determined from a network aggregated over all time points.",,,,
Such aggregate networks can be used for representation themselves as in Figure 2.,,,,
Animation and small-multiples are treated in depth in [4].,,,,
"We are interested in static representations suitable for traditional publication media, but instead of aggregating observations into a summary network, they will be integrated in a single view witho,ut in,formation,""loss.,""",,,,
"3 DYAD E VOLUTION As motivated above, we are looking for an intuitive way to communicate entire dyadic evolution clearly and effectively through simple graphical means.",,,,
"In a second step, then, such a representation shall be incorporated into a matrix view, conveying the entirety of dyadic time-series in network panel data in a single diagram to allow for visual exp,lorat,ion of pa,""tterns, trends, and outliers.,""",,,,
3.1 Concept: Gestaltlines The proposed design is a prototypical application of what we termed gestaltlines.,,,,
"It is, hence, inspired by a combination of three powerful concepts from information visualization: Tufte's Sparklines are ?쐂ata-intense, design-simple, word-sized graphics??[54].",,,,
"These datawords are conventionally used for univariate time-series data ??potentially enriched with additional annotation to convey, e.g., normal ranges and individual data points, such as [54, p. 4,7] ??,but appli,""cable in other scenarios such as in [24] as well.,""",,,,
"On simple (high-resolution, colored) printouts, sparkline-like diagrams allow for the display of huge amounts of data within eyespan.",,,,
"The latter is useful especially for exploration, when it is not clear from the start which quantities to compare.",,,,
"Gestalt theory deals mainly qualitatively with human biases towards perceiving general forms, meaning that ?쐔he whole is different from the sum of its parts??",,,,
"According to Wertheimer [57], the Law of Pra?gnanz causes the mind to organize originally disparate visual stimuli into the simplest stable and coherent form (see, e.g., [48]), such as grouping toge,ther,similarly,""looking , spatially close , uniformly connected , and symmetrical [ ] < { } > elements, or layering elements according to prominence (law of 詮갾ure and ground).,""",,,,
"These principles guide design choices, e.g., in visual screen design [10], human-computer interaction [18], information dashboard design [17] or animated visualizations of network data [39].",,,,
"Multivariate Glyphs originate from systematic mappings of multiple data attributes onto graphical concepts (see, e.g., [55]).",,,,
"A popular example are star plots [9], in which line segments that radiate out from a common origin represent different data dimensions.",,,,
Connecting their outer endpoints and 詮걄ling the center creates a holistic gestalt that is more easily memorized and compared than the data tuple.,,,,
"Obviously, glyph-based techniques allow to extend classical sparklines to multivariate datawords.",,,,
"Dense, data-rich diagrams, however, do not necessarily lend themselves to visual promotion of any kind of pattern.",,,,
"Therefore, gestaltlines shall be combinations of glyphs and sparklines that are directly inspired by gestalt principles: If patterns in the data are bound to invoke gestalt laws, a dataword is capit,alizi,ng on the,""holistic capabilities of human vision by conveying trends, transitions, outliers, or other sequence patterns.,""",,,,
The derivation of corresponding representations for asymmetric relations in longitudinal networks is illustrated below.,,,,
"The following textbook example involving univariate sequences, however, should make the idea obvious: Sedgewick [44] illustrates the procedure of bottom-up mergesort by depicting an initial , an int,ermed,iate and,""the 詮걆al sorted sequence using sloped lines that indicate numerical values.,""",,,,
"Their gradually changing slopes prompt us to perceive sorted subsequences as a whole, in which outliers are detected easily.",,,,

Small multiples of network panel data with uniform outdegree.,,,,
Red/blue color scale represents lower/higher-than-expected indegree.,,,,
"3.2 Basic Design A simple design, exploiting the impact of gestalt principles and mapping relational/dyadic (ego-alter) data quite naturally to graphical concepts, emanates from the metaphor of a se,esaw,""or scale,"",""respectively.,""",,,,
"More speci詮갷ally, take a transparent tube which is subdivided and pivoted in the middle: Being empty in the beginning it is successively (un)詮걄led from the middle, according to the extent of rat,ings,on a rela,""tion Our design choices are based on intuition and gestalt principles.,""",,,,
"While a single seesaw intuitively represents the concept of imbalance, their alignment is intended to invoke the gestalt principle of common fate, which states that graphical elements of similar ori,entat,ion are p,""erceived as a whole even when they differ in other attributes such as size.,""",,,,
"Similarly, motivations to enhance the basic design are addressed in Section 3.3.",,,,
"The conscious exploitation of gestalt principles appears to add a new twist to the use of glyphs and may contrast the proposed graphical mapping from other designs working also in small-scale such a,s jux,taposed b,""ar charts mapping time on the vertical axis (Figure 5), rotated horizon graphs [28] or data vases [49].,""",,,,
"which, of course, may result in imbalance With this rather minimalistic glyph design, including the additional dimension of time to form a single (letter-like) dataword is now straightforward.",,,,
Some may 詮걆d the stacking below reminiscent of a modernistic depiction of a falling tube tumbling left and right according the balance of its 詮걄ling.,,,,
This is intentional because it is in line with our basic metaphor.,,,,
"Since human perception is geared toward comparison of progress with respect to some grounded baseline, however, we use bottom-up visualizations of development instead; compare Figure 4.",,,,
Fig.,,,,
4,,,,
Basic graphical design (read bottom to top) for any dyadic timeseries (read left to right).,,,,
Typical examples would be ego-alter ratings on a relationship.,,,,
"Patterns, trends, and outliers are clearly visible and interpretable ???쏷heir relationship was an emotional seesaw.??The graphical mapping displays both quantities of interest, the absolute values,(exte,nt) and t,""heir differences (balance/reciprocity), simultaneously: ??the higher the weight on an edge, the more ink (irrespective of the degree of balance) ??the more imbalance in a dyad, the more prominent the slope (irrespective of the size of weights) Fig.,""",,,,
5,,,,
"Gestalt-based representation of dyad evolution compared to conventional times series charts displaying the difference of values, contrasting both values, or juxtaposing maximum extent and difference,"".,"",,",,,,
"On a second level, the alignment of multiple dyad time series gestalts in a matrix arrangement is expected to support exploration of patterns for egos, alters, and groups of them.",,,,
More details are provided in Section 4.,,,,
"3.3 Enhancements The minimalist nature of the basic glyph design allows for additional enhancements, inspired by gestalt laws.",,,,
"First of all, the current design leaves color as a degree of freedom to represent additional attributes; cf.",,,,
[26] for various coloring schemes.,,,,
"For instance, single data values or special data ranges can be highlighted or mitigated, exploiting the law of 詮갾ure and ground, as exempli詮갻d within the case study below.",,,,
Another particular application in social networks would be the fading out of uncon詮걊med relations because these may be a critical factor in relational data collection [33].,,,,
"Alternatively, color could be used to combine and distinguish different ranges of extent and/or balance as suggested by the law of similarity.",,,,
We already alluded to claim that human perception subconsciously relates progress with respect to some baseline.,,,,
One may capitalize on this by explicitly indicating a reference line that incorporates additional (statistical) information at the bottom of each gestalt.,,,,
"We even suggest to use two reference lines where appropriate, e.g., one indicating the expected time-series values in the beginning and one indicating the expected values at the end of the evolution,"".,"",,",,,,
"Although this is rarely the case in network survey data, we do note that if there are too many points in time, a horizontal representation of evolution might be more appropriate for word-like repres,entat,""ions.,"",",,,,
"That is, vertical lines are depicted next to each other, metaphorically indicating balance as ?쐓table??, or toppling towards ego , or alter , respectively ??banking angles to 45 degrees where appro,priat,""e [27].,"",",,,,
"4 N ETWORK E VOLUTION On high-resolution small-scale displays such as paper, multiple dyad gestalts can be combined easily to enable visual exploration of patterns, trends, and outliers in complete,longi,tudinal n,""etwork data by simple means: 4.1 Matrix Representation Their character-like representation enables a straightforward integration of dyad gestalts into what we refer to as a gestaltmatrix.,""",,,,
"Each matrix entry mi j depicts a single dyad gestalt, i.e.",,,,
the evolution of the complete dyadic time-series of ego i and alter j.,,,,
"Note that matrix entries mi j and m ji are redundant, since depicted gestalts are just mirrored at the vertical axes.",,,,
The full matrix is displayed nevertheless to capitalize on the alignment across rows and columns.,,,,
"It facilitates, therefore, the detection of overall patterns, trends, and outliers from an ego point of view (the row) or from the view of all others (the column), respectively.",,,,
"To the best of our knowledge, the most similar approach to representing change in social networks has been proposed in [47].",,,,
"There, the authors indicate time through various subdivisions of matrix cells, mapping each data value to a single colored pixel; relation \x05??color.",,,,
Such an atomistic treatment is highly ef詮갷ient in terms of visualizing ?쐔he largest amount of data which is possible on current displays??[32].,,,,
"In terms of gestalt laws, however, a holistic mapping ??relation \x05??angle & length ??seems to be more appropriate for indicating extent and balance (cf.",,,,
Figure 5).,,,,
"Other related approaches involve animation and interaction, such as toggling the colors of matrix cells according to a queried time range [23].",,,,
4.2 Matrix Ordering The crucial degree of freedom in a matrix-based network representation is the ordering of actors which determines the permutation of rows and columns.,,,,
"In social network analysis, orderings are often determined to highlight higher level organization in the matrix.",,,,
"The corresponding technique of blockmodeling (see, e.g., [14]) refers to substantively meaningful rearrangements that (visually) reveal regularities of the network structure within the matrix cells.,"","",,",,,,
"For instance, one may be interested in cohesive groups and thus order the matrix so that locally dense groups form blocks along the diagonal.",,,,
"While this is not the only criterion, it is certainly among the one most commonly used.",,,,
"For most scenarios, however, 詮걆ding an optimal permutation is N P-hard.",,,,
Various heuristics to calculate acceptable solutions for given criteria have been proposed.,,,,
A comprehensive overview of blockmodeling techniques is provided in [14].,,,,
"Since we aim for a single matrix-like diagram conveying the entire network evolution, we here de詮걆e an aggregated actor similarity that, subsequently, can be used as the input to a blockmodeling a,pproa,""ch.,"",",,,,
"In other words, we describe a dyad by some similarity measure s that summarizes the time-series information mi j = \x03 \x02 s (di1j , d 1ji ), .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
", (diTj , d Tji ) .",,,,
The quality of an ordering obtained from such a similarity depends on its suitability for the analytic perspective.,,,,
"As a default that can be used in the absence of more speci詮갷 requirements, we\x04 propose to sum T the geometric means of dyadic ratings, mi j = ?몋=1 dit j 쨌 d tji .",,,,
This represents a reasonable general-purpose solution because of its tendency to group actors with consistently high and balanced weights.,,,,
Part of the rationale is the correspondence of the geometric mean with the amount of ink and slope used in the seesaw design.,,,,
5 C ASE S TUDY We illustrate and further elaborate the proposed principles on one of the most well-known longitudinal data sets in social network analysis.,,,,
"Being the subject of many previous analyses, the data is ideally suited to demonstrate our method's capability to provide previously unexplored insights.",,,,
5.1 Data The data comprises complete sociometric preference rankings ???쁫ike best??to ?쁫ike least????among 17 previously unacquainted male students at the University of Michigan in the mid 50s.,,,,
"The rankings were collected in 15 consecutive weeks and have been published in [40, 42].",,,,
"Since all participants got free accommodation in fraternity housing, the data is commonly referred to as Newcomb Fraternity Data.",,,,
"The development of friendships in the Newcomb Fraternity Data has been (re)analyzed numerous times, e.g., in [52, 35, 15, 38, 58].",,,,
"Notably, it has also been used as an illustrating example in the introduction of stochastic actor-oriented models for dynamic network analysis [45].",,,,
"Most descriptions of the Newcomb Fraternity Data have been based on summary measures, data aggregations and cross-sectional network views as in Figures 2 and 3.",,,,
"Beyond that, various animations between single states have been presented, e.g., in [35].",,,,
"Even with the most sophisticated animations, though, attempting to describe and compare the evolution of multiple relationships or detecting interesting patterns ??such as non-requited friendship no,minat,ions ??in,""evitably results in cognitive overload.,""",,,,
"The question is, thus, whether an analyst can gain further insights from the proposed static views on the overall evolution.",,,,
"5.2 Exploring Individual Relations Throughout the observation span, most mutual rankings in the Newcomb Fraternity Data are highly inconsistent, which indicates a low level of reciprocity or a high,level,of imbal,""ance, respectively.,""",,,,
"This ?쐋arge number of asymmetric ties suggests that we might gain some insight by using a layout method that accounts for this asymmetry??[35, page 1228].",,,,
"Given highly asymmetric relational data, however, directed (node-)link representations become less comprehensible already in the static case [30].",,,,
"In contrast, the proposed static gestalt-based representation provides a convenient and intuitive way to explore and communicate extent and balance in asymmetric relations.",,,,
"Because of their small, letter-like space requirements, the graphics can be used directly inside of (publishable) text.",,,,
"In this way, it is not necessary to go back and forth between an explanation and a diagram ??facilitating comprehension, improving readability and conveying more information.",,,,
For illustration compare the two paragraphs in Figure 6 with regard to the entropy of information.,,,,
"?쏯odes 10 and 15, for example, quickly emerge as nodes on the edge of the social structure.",,,,
"While they nominate each other symmetrically early in the observation period, they lose interest in each other by the end.",,,,
Neither node receives top-詮걐e nominations from any other node in the network.,,,,
"Their nominations to others seem to dance around the graph, never resting for long on a single person.??[35, p. 1228] \x0c5.3 Exploring Groups of Relations Besides the persistent asymmetry in friend,ship,rankings,""and large heterogeneity in the popularity of actors (addressed below), the evolution of group structures within the Newcomb Fraternity Data has been studied extensively.,""",,,,
"Evaluating blockmodeling algorithms according to the density of inter- and intra-block top ratings, e.g., White et al. state that ?쐀y at least the 詮갽th week not only the 詮걆al blocks but also th,e 詮걆,al block,""model have emerged with remarkable clarity??58, page 764].,""",,,,
Their 詮걆dings basically con詮걊m the actor groups originally proposed by Nordlie [42] based on rank correlations.,,,,
"Nakao and Romney [38] provide further evidence for structural convergence in the Newcomb Fraternity Data by relating the number of concordant (c) and discordant (d) rankings with Goodman-Kruskal's,Gamma,coef詮갷,""ient (c?뭗)/(c+d) ??[??, 1].,""",,,,

"An exception can be found in [38], where the authors use multidimensional scaling to place actors in the plane according to the similarities of their rankings at a given point in time.",,,,
"Then, Procrustes analysis is used to align each actor's positions over time, as indicated by the convex hulls presented in Figure 7(b).",,,,

The sorting of actors is according to a spectral approach described in the main text.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
7,,,,
Previous descriptions of groups in Newcomb Fraternity Data.,,,,
Any grouping can be visualized compactly and evaluated in a single gestaltmatrix without data aggregation.,,,,
"For illustration we here use an ordering based on the number of inversions in consecutive rankings , which assumes local minima in week 8 and week 12.",,,,
"Thus, the ratings in week 7 and week 11 are rather stable and, therefore, reasonable proxies for static representations.",,,,
"We choose week 11 and sort actors according to their values in the Fiedler \x04 vector of the Laplacian matrix obtained from (mi j ), where mi j = di11j 쨌 d 11 ji if both ratings are top 3-ratings,and m,i j = 0 o,""therwise.,""",,,,
This choice of similarity measure is motivated by the common use of thresholding in published reanalyses of the Newcomb Fraternity Data; compare Figures 2 and 3.,,,,
The resulting gestaltmatrix is presented in Figure 8.,,,,
A block structure due to higher internal rankings is clearly visible.,,,,
As suggested in Section 3.3 we augment the plain color design.,,,,
"First, inspired by the gestalt principle of 詮갾ure and ground, we combine two different hues: using black for highlighting top 3 values of the extent and gray for fading the others, we intend to as,sess,the resul,""t of the commonly used thresholding before the background of the full data set.,""",,,,
"Second, motivated by the gestalt principle of similarity, we distinguish different types of actors by coloring them according to their standardized popularity over time.",,,,
"Popular actors are colored blue, whereas unpopular actors are colored red.",,,,
"More speci詮갷ally, we evaluated the deviation ? from a null model, assuming that at each time step, each actor obtains each possible ranking at a time, i.e.",,,,
"關 = ??j\x06=i d tji /k = k/2, with k = #{ j \x06= i} and assuming rankings from k to 1.",,,,
This gives where ? refers to the standard deviation of a single ranking d tji from 關 and T is the number of panels.,,,,
A variant gestaltmatrix with identical coloring is shown in Figure 10.,,,,
In this matrix we reproduce an ordering of the actors proposed in [38].,,,,
"With the gestaltmatrix view on the complete evolution of relations, however, additional insights can be obtained from the more re詮걆ed perspective.",,,,
"Consider the column of the ?쐓capegoat in this group (man 10), who received one of the bottom three choices of each of the other persons??[58, p. 759].",,,,
It is clearly visible which others did overrate the ?쁲capegoat??in the beginning.,,,,
"Interestingly, these include the overall most popular actors 17, 4 and 9.",,,,
"Also, a strong desire of the most unpopular actors to be friends especially with the popular actors is revealed.",,,,
"To the best of our knowledge, these 詮걆dings on the Newcomb Fraternity Data have never been published before, despite long-standing investigations spanning various disciplines.",,,,
"As a concluding example, we stress once more the potential to complement and critically inform existing analyses, based on animation or interaction.",,,,
Figure 9 demonstrates the consequences.,,,,
"?쏤or example, one can see that nodes 1, 6, 8, and 13 remain strongly connected to each other throughout the observation period, occupying a small cluster at the right of the graph.",,,,
"Nodes 7, 12, and 4 form a cluster early in the groups history, but node 4 then breaks with this group at about week 8, instead nominating nodes 17 and 2.??[35, p. 1228] \x0cFig.",,,,

6 E XPERT F EEDBACK The representation proposed here is intended for domain expert use and scienti詮갷 communication.,,,,
"While it is currently being used in several cooperations, we may not show proprietary data in this paper.",,,,
"This is one reason why, in the case study of Section 5, we resorted to a well known and fairly typical data set which, in addition, has been the subject of many previous analyses.",,,,
We will ultimately be interested in a quantitative comparison assessing the relative ef詮갷iency of our design in communicating extent and balance in asymmetric relations.,,,,
"In the absence of suf詮갷iently similar previous approaches, however, the number of dimensions and confounding factors appears to be too large for a formal, well-focused user study to be included in,this,paper [1,""1].,""",,,,
Instead we rely on external expert reviews [51] as an initial sanity check.,,,,
"Because of its intuitiveness and some other obvious bene詮걎s (static representation, generality, printability, publishability) we did assume that social scientists are willing to spend the 詮걐e mi,nutes,it takes,""to understand the design and learn how to read it.,""",,,,
"The method was therefore presented at INSNA Sunbelt XXXI Social Networks Conference,1 the main venue for networks in the social sciences (no published proceedings).",,,,
Interest was surprisingly high and feedback overwhelmingly positive; even to the point that the idea was taken up and applied in another presentation at the same conference within two days.,,,,
"Fourteen senior domain experts and a number of other delegates provided personal feedback in private and informal face-to-face discussions, with all but three approaching us before we could ask them,to.,"","",",,,,
"They mentioned in particular the simplicity, intuitiveness, and aesthetic appeal of the design, and the ease by which tendencies and outliers can be detected both on the actor and dyad level.",,,,
"They also mentioned the compact and simultaneous representation of the entire data set, allowing back and forth comparison of matrix rows and cells.",,,,
"Generally, they were aware of the fact that distances between vertices are dif詮갷ult to determine in matrix representation, but needed help in understanding the consequences of row and column reord,ering,and the,""reliability of conclusions drawn from a given ordering.,""",,,,
The latter was somewhat surprising because this aspect of our design is shared with any matrix representation of networks.,,,,
"Under the name sociomatrix the latter are known well in this domain [36, 19].",,,,
"Feedback was particularly vocal from the modeling community, where the interest is in identifying factors that govern the evolution of dyads [46].",,,,
"Detecting evolving patterns and, in particular, exceptional actors, is of great importance in these approaches because current models rely on fairly strong homogeneity assumptions.",,,,
The gestaltbased design was found to serve this purpose better than anything our respondents had known before.,,,,
"These impressions were con詮걊med during a dedicated modeling workshop,2 where we worked with two groups to represent their data appropriately in our design.",,,,
"Encouraged by the reactions so far, we plan to make the approach available in more generally accessible form, possibly in our tool visone.3 7 D ISCUSSION We proposed a novel methodology for static v,isual,ization o,""f longitudinal asymmetric network data, which we refer to as gestaltmatrix.,""",,,,
"It is based on word-sized representations of dyadic evolution, which in turn represent an application of gestaltlines, i.e.",,,,
multivariate sparklines capitalizing on gestalt principles.,,,,
"While, currently, scepticism with regard to glyph-based approaches to representing multidimensional data appears to dominate, our work is in line with other recent work such as [41], in which it is,sugge,sted that,""additional perceptually-effective forms of compact multidimensional representation may await discovery and characterization.,""",,,,
"Since our approach provides novel means to explore and communicate the extent and balance of values in dyads, it can also be used to complement existing techniques that require animation or interact,ion.,"","",",,,,
"Next to some obvious bene詮걎s such as effective communication of 詮걆dings and suitability for publication on paper we also demonstrated that gestalt-based network analysis bears the potential to y,ield,additiona,""l insight even into data that was previously studied extensively.,""",,,,
"Additionally, we revealed misinterpretations that we suspect resulted from more aggregate data views.",,,,
"There are many ways in which additional information about, e.g., volatility or other attributes can be integrated into a gestaltmatrix design.",,,,
We have only shown one example by indicating the average popularity of each actor on the diagonal.,,,,
"The main goal was to argue that a detailed design can lead to interpretable forms on the level of the dyad (matrix cell), the actor (row), and the network (matrix).",,,,
"These forms are likely to ease the discovery of trends, change events, and outliers.",,,,
There are two major limitations for the scope of our method.,,,,
"The 詮걊st one is shared with all matrix representations of networks, namely that paths are dif詮갷ult to discover and follow.",,,,
"The other one is a consequence of our attempt to bring out a joint appearance of the data in a dyad; as a consequence, individual time slices are dif詮갷ult to extract.",,,,
Possible remedies for these two problems may lie in a combination of the seesaw metaphor with node-link diagrams and by using gestaltlines highlighting the current point in time as edge labels.,,,,
"These, however, require more careful research.",,,,
In ongoing collaborations with social scientists we are dealing with specialized data sets that contain in excess of 100 actors.,,,,
This can be considered an upper limit for the large majority of empirical studies also from the modeling point of view.,,,,
"For larger networks, however, larger print and, possibly, a hierarchical design may become necessary.",,,,
Qualitative evidence on the acceptance and intuitive understanding of the proposed principles was provided based on informal feedback from domain experts.,,,,
Further research shall include a quantitative assessment of the impact that gestaltmatrices have on the understanding of asymmetric relations in longitudinal social networks.,,,,

"Abstract?봊n various domains, there are abundant streams or sequences of multi-item data of various kinds, e.g. streams of news and social media texts, sequences of genes and sports events, etc.",,,,
Comparison is an important and general task in data analysis.,,,,
"For comparing data streams involving multiple items (e.g., words in texts, actors or action types in action sequences, visited places in itineraries, etc.",,,,
"), we propose Co-Bridges, a visual design involving connection and comparison techniques that reveal similarities and differences between two streams.",,,,
"Co-Bridges use river and bridge metaphors, where two sides of a river represent data streams, and bridges connect temporally or sequentially aligned segments of streams.",,,,
Commonalities and differences between these segments in terms of involvement of various items are shown on the bridges.,,,,
Interactive query tools support the selection of particular stream subsets for focused exploration.,,,,
"The visualization supports both qualitative (common and distinct items) and quantitative (stream volume, amount of item involvement) comparisons.",,,,
"We further propose Comparison-of-Comparisons, in which two or more Co-Bridges corresponding to different selections are juxtaposed.",,,,
"We test the applicability of the Co-Bridges in different domains, including social media text streams and sports event sequences.",,,,
We perform an evaluation of the users??capability to understand and use Co-Bridges.,,,,
The results confirm that Co-Bridges is effective for supporting pair-wise visual comparisons in a wide range of applications.,,,,
"Index Terms?봙isual Comparison, Pair-wise Analysis, Multi-item Data Stream, Social Media  INTRODUCTION Nowadays there are more and more data streams in our lives: messages are posted on social media,; ser,ies of ne,""ws stories are presented on the Internet; events and actions occurring in sports competitions and games are tracked; people record and share their travel diaries; and many others.,""",,,,
"These data streams usually involve multiple items, e.g. keywords, types of actions or events, participants of activities, or visited places.",,,,
"In exploring these data, one may be interested not only to see patterns of item involvement (what items, when, and how much) within individual streams but also to compare the patterns between data s,tream,""s.,"",",,,,
"For example, during a presidential election campaign, people may wish to see the differences between the candidates??agendas and ideas concerning multiple issues and explore how these evolved over t,""ime,"",as reflec,""ted in the streams of the candidates??social media messages.,""",,,,
"Thus, techniques are required for supporting comparison of such multi-item data streams.",,,,
Comparison is a general and important task for many analysis scenarios [28].,,,,
Our research goal is to provide a general solution supporting pair-wise comparison of multi-item data streams in terms of the involvement of different items along time.,,,,
The research challenge is two-fold.,,,,
"First, each data stream by itself is a complex dynamic phenomenon involving diverse items, and it is thus not easy to compare two such streams.",,,,
"Second, it is not obvious how to generate an informative visual summary for the comparison that conveys the similarities and \x0cdifferences of the dynamic patterns.",,,,
Visual Encoding for Comparison: (1) Time Feature - River Curve (2) Multiple Items - Block Size/Ratio/Position (3) Additional Attributes - Bars on the bridge Fig.,,,,
2,,,,
The visual metaphor for comparison.,,,,
A bridge connects corresponding segments of two data streams.,,,,
Multiple items appearing in these parts of the streams are shown on the bridge.,,,,
"To address the above challenges, we propose Co-Bridges, a visualisation technique for pair-wise visual connection and comparison of multi-item data streams (Figure 2).",,,,
We base on a river-and-bridge metaphor in the visualisation design.,,,,
"The river metaphor is quite often adopted for representing data streams [21, 54].",,,,
We take this popular metaphor but adapt it to the need of supporting stream comparison.,,,,
"In Co-Bridges, each of the two river sides represents one data stream.",,,,
"We choose to show the river flow along the vertical display dimension; hence, the time or sequence is encoded by the vertical axis.",,,,
The vertical layout allows several river instances to be juxtaposed in a display.,,,,
"The items occurring in the streams under comparison are shown on the bridges connecting corresponding parts of the river sides, i.e., parts of the streams having the same positions along the time or,in t,he sequen,""ce.,""",,,,
"The design is aimed to provide a quick visual summary of the frequently occurring items, their relative frequencies, and the qualitative and quantitative changes over time.",,,,
"To further support the exploration process, we provide interactive techniques for attribute-based selection of sub-streams for focused comparisons and enable the exploratory operation ?쏞omparison o,f Com,parisons?,""?by juxtaposing several instances of Co-Bridges connecting and comparing different sub-streams.,""",,,,
These techniques allow performing sophisticated analytical workflows.,,,,
"Our paper describes the following research contributions: 2.1 Data Stream Visual Analytics Various domains are generating multi-item data streams [1, 56].",,,,
"Social media visual analytics is one of the spotlight field analyzing data streams [17, 50].",,,,
"Analysis of dynamic text streams may focus on topics and sentiments [24,45,57] or event evolution [13,15,23,51].",,,,
Diakopoulos et al. [23] used multiple word clouds along the time to visualize how events were reflected in social media.,,,,
Textflow visualized evolving topics in social media with a visual metaphor of a river [21].,,,,
"Leadline summarized the event definition as ?쏷opic, Time, People, Location??and visualized the events with multiple timeline streams [24].",,,,
"Researchers further focused on the dynamic relationship between topics, including topic competition [54] and topic cooperation [45]; the river metaphor was also used in these works.",,,,
These approaches didn?셳 explicitly focus on stream comparison tasks.,,,,
"OpinionFlow [52] addressed comparison tasks, but the primary focus was on revealing opinion propagation among groups of social media users rather than considering similarities and differences betwee,n str,""eams.,"",",,,,
"Besides social media, much research has been devoted to analyzing various data streams including event sequences, such as gene sequences [55], web clickstream sequences [38], medical record sequence,s [30,""], etc.,"",",,,,
Chen et al. [18] and Guo et al. [31] focused on generating visual summaries of event sequences.,,,,
"Gotz et al. [29, 30] deal with high-dimensional event sequences using aggregation.",,,,
Comparison is a general task being implicitly or explicitly involved in many data stream analyses.,,,,
"However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior works address the task of pair-wise visual comparison of data streams.",,,,
"Supporting such comparison can be useful for various applications, The paper is structured as follows.",,,,
Section 2 reviews the related work.,,,,
"We define the comparison elements, challenges, and strategy overview in Section 3.",,,,
We present the design of Co-Bridges in Section 4 and the suggested visual comparison workflow in Section 5.,,,,
We present two data analysis cases in Section 6 and a user study in Section 7.,,,,
"Finally, we discuss the limitations and the generalizability of the proposed approach and conclude in Section 8.",,,,
2.2 Visual Metaphors in Visual Analytics A good visual metaphor can help analysts to explore and interpret information.,,,,
General design guidelines and tools are described by Borgo et al. [5].,,,,
PeopleGarden uses the metaphors of a flower and a garden to encode people's profiles [53].,,,,
"Yi et al. proposed Dust & magnet, using a magnet metaphor to encode attribute and dust encodes the data to visualize the high-dimensional data [43].",,,,
"In Whisper, the sunflower metaphor is used to visualize information spreading among different regions of the world [8].",,,,
SentenTree provides a new perspective to understand the relationship among keywords and their context in the sentence and visualize the structure with the tree metaphor [32].,,,,
"In the following, we discuss the metaphors that related the most to our design, including the river and map metaphors.",,,,
"Due to the association between the flow of a river and the flow of time, the river metaphor is widely used for different analysis scenarios involving dynamic phenomena [21, 36, 47, 49].",,,,
Tiara visualized the text cloud in multiple layers of a theme river-like visualization [49].,,,,
RankExplorer developed glyphs indicating the change of ranking in the river metaphor [42].,,,,
Other river-like visualizations can indicate branching patterns of topic evolution [21] or lead-lag patterns of topics [47].,,,,
Some other designs extend the river metaphor.,,,,
Episogram visualized the social interactions as curved glyphs along the time [9].,,,,
SocialHelix visualized the divergences and how they evolved among different social groups with a DNA-like design [10].,,,,
Semantic Space Time Cube visualized the spatial-temporal and topic variation with river and card designs [36].,,,,
Another representative series of visual metaphors is map-like visual designs.,,,,
GMap visualizes clusters and graphs in the form of a cartographic map [25].,,,,
"Chen et al. proposed a series of map-like visualization, including D-Map [14], E-Map [13], and R-Map [16] for exploring contents of social media.",,,,
"The idea of the map-like visualization is using a familiar concept as a metaphor helping users to explore complex data, e.g. texts or other multi-item data.",,,,
"Inspired by both river-like metaphors showing dynamic features and map-like metaphors focusing on the spatial arrangement, we design a new visual metaphor for visual comparison called Co-Bridges.",,,,
"2 R ELATED W ORK We review the related work on data stream visual analytics, the use of visual metaphors for visual analytics, and visual comparison techniques.",,,,
2.3 Visual Comparison One of the important analysis tasks to be supported by visualization is comparison.,,,,
Gleicher et al. summarized three main approaches to ??A new visualisation metaphor for pair-wise visual comparison.,,,,
Co-Bridges supports both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of general multi-item data streams.,,,,
??Interaction techniques for sub-stream selection and exploratory operation Comparison-of-Comparisons.,,,,
The user can select sub-streams according to different criteria and compare dynamic similarity-difference patterns between different sub-stream pairs.,,,,
??Generalizability to different applications.,,,,
We tested the design in case studies and conducted a formal user study with two applications: social media text streams and events of a football game.,,,,
Our studies showed that the design of Co-Bridges is general and easy to use for comparison tasks.,,,,
"enabling visual comparison: juxtaposition, superposition, and explicit encoding of relationships [28].",,,,
"For example, genomics sequences were visualized side by side using juxtaposition [2].",,,,
Hexagon maps were superposed as information layers in a common display space [39].,,,,
Mauve used explicit encoding by linking to correlate the conservative parts of the genomics sequences [22].,,,,
"There were many works in visualization on supporting visual comparison of different kinds of information, including tree structures [7, 35], spatio-temporal data [4, 37], sequences and time-series [,""20, 3"",""7], image"",""s [41], models [3, 33], etc.,""",,,,
Von Landesberger summarized the research challenges for visual comparison [46].,,,,
"Researchers from the perception and psychology domain also conducted studies of perceptual aspects of visual comparison [40, 44].",,,,
A tool called Duet was developed to enable data analysis novices easily conduct pair-wise comparisons [34].,,,,
"By investigating many comparison examples, Gleicher summarized the design considerations for visual comparison [27], which guided us in our work.",,,,
Visual comparison of texts is one of the application scenarios related to our research.,,,,
Text comparison is mostly supported by means of juxtaposition.,,,,
"It was applied, for example, to the results of word embedding [12] and multiple word clouds [11].",,,,
Parallel tag clouds combine the techniques of the word cloud and parallel coordinates to support the comparison of keyword usage in multiple documents [19].,,,,
Wang et al. proposed several glyph designs supporting the comparison of online reviews for companies [48].,,,,
Alexander and Gleicher proposed a visual comparison method for topic models [3].,,,,
They allowed analysts to interactively align details of topic models.,,,,
OCTVis used explicit linking encoding to compare the ontology of different models [26].,,,,
"Different from previous works, we propose a design for visual comparison based on a new metaphor that can be used for comparing multi-item data streams.",,,,
3 OVERVIEW We follow the design consideration proposed by Gleicher [27] to frame our research.,,,,
"We discuss the comparison elements, comparison challenges, comparison strategies, and comparison designs.",,,,
"3.1 Comparison Elements Comparison is an analysis with more than one target [6, 27].",,,,
Our target data type is general data streams containing multiple different items.,,,,
A data stream is an ordered collection of data records in which each record refers to a time moment or a position (step) in a sequence.,,,,
"In our research, we consider data streams in which data records include or refer to multiple different items (entities of any nature), denoted by their labels.",,,,
"Apart from the temporal or sequential references and labeled items, data in the streams may include other components.",,,,
We shall refer to them as attributes.,,,,
The goal of analysis in our research is to compare two data streams in terms of the items appearing in the data over time or along the sequence.,,,,
"The comparison concerns the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the item appearance, that is, the item identities and the frequencies of their appearance or degrees of their involvement.",,,,
"As the amounts of information in the full streams may be too large, users should be able to select sub-streams for detailed comparison.",,,,
A sub-stream is an ordered subset of records from a stream.,,,,
Sub-streams can be selected based on different attributes available in the stream data.,,,,
We give two examples to illustrate the concepts and show the possible stream comparison tasks.,,,,
"In social media, the comparison target can be text streams, such as a series of tweets, produced by different users.",,,,
The items in these streams are meaningful keywords used in the texts.,,,,
"One can select different sub-streams of these streams for comparison based on attributes of the data, such as text topic, or location from which the messages were posted, or the time of the day when,the,texts wer,""e produced.,""",,,,
"For example, one may select tweets discussing the issue ?쐆ealthcare?? see what significant keywords were used in the discussion, and compare the usage of these keywords by different people.",,,,
Another data example is a sequence of events happening in a ball game conducted by two teams of players.,,,,
The comparison target is the sequences of the actions and events that happened under the ball possession by the two teams.,,,,
"The items are the players, the actions performed by them, and events like goal or foul.",,,,
"The comparison tasks can be summarized as follows: ??Comparison of data stream dynamics: Compare the temporal or sequential patterns of data streams, focusing on the (T1) numerical trends at (T2) di,ffere,nt levels,""of granularity.,""",,,,
"??Comparison of items: Provide (T3) qualitative comparison (common or distinct) and (T4) quantitative comparison (relative frequencies, absolute amounts, etc.)",,,,
of the items in the streams.,,,,
??Comparison of comparisons: Compare overall similaritydifference patterns and numeric trends of different pairs of substreams (T5).,,,,
3.2 Comparison Challenges The streams may be large (include many data records) and complex (include many data items).,,,,
"Currently, there is a lack of an intuitive approach to the comparison of such data and a suitable method of creating a visual summary for general multi-item data streams.",,,,
"The challenges can be summarized as: ??C1: High cardinality of the item set, such that a comprehensive view of complete streams is hardly possible.",,,,
"??C2: Dynamic character of the data regarding the stream volumes, the presence of different items, and their frequencies or amounts.",,,,
"??C3: Comparison of sub-stream pairs, which requires a compact representation of the similarities and differences and their dynamics in each pair.",,,,
3.3 Comparison Strategy A comparison strategy summarizes how we intend to support users in comparing data streams.,,,,
"For creating an appropriate design, we need to envisage how users would possibly conduct the comparison.",,,,
We assume that users will apply the following strategies for dealing with the comparison challenges [27]: ??S1: Scan sequentially and drill down.,,,,
"According to the dynamic and sequential nature of the data streams, users will compare items while scanning the streams sequentially.",,,,
Users can drill down to a time range of interest for a more detailed comparison.,,,,
??S2: Iteratively select subsets based on attributes.,,,,
Users select data subsets for comparison based on various attributes.,,,,
The data in the subsets are ordered in the same manner as in the whole streams and can thus be seen as sub-streams and visualised in the same way as the original streams.,,,,
??S3: Gain an overview of comparison.,,,,
Users obtain an abstracted visual summary of dynamic similarity-difference patterns of a pair of data streams.,,,,
Summaries for different sub-stream pairs can be compared.,,,,
Our design should enable the foreseen comparison tasks and support the users??strategies in addressing the challenges.,,,,
We describe our visualisation design in the following section.,,,,
4 C O -B RIDGES : V ISUALISATION D ESIGN Figure 2 presents the main idea of our design.,,,,
An implementation of this design for supporting comparison of social media text streams is used for illustration (Figure 3b).,,,,
4.1 Design Rationale: Why Bridge?,,,,
"Combining the river and bridge visual metaphors, Co-Bridges is a design including multiple connecting bridges for visual comparison of two multi-item data streams associated with two sides of a rive,""r.,"",,",,,,
River metaphor.,,,,
"Our design builds on the Theme River metaphor [21, 49], which presents a single multi-item stream.",,,,
This metaphor gained high popularity and is considered successful.,,,,
"However, it has not been designed for explicit pair-wise comparison.",,,,
We extend this idea to supporting comparison of two streams.,,,,
We maintain the basic concept and appearance of a river but use the river sides to \x0cFig.,,,,
3,,,,
A visual exploration interface for pair-wise comparison using Co-Bridges is illustrated using social media data (b).,,,,
The issue selection view (a) provides a graph of significant keywords.,,,,
"When a user selects some keyword in a specific time, the corresponding texts (tweets) containing the keyword are shown in the detail view (c).",,,,
refer to two streams.,,,,
"The shapes of the river sides encode the evolution of numeric features of the data streams, e.g., stream volumes.",,,,
Bridge metaphor.,,,,
We need to make connections between corresponding parts of the two streams for presenting their similarities and differences regarding the items involved.,,,,
"For this purpose, we introduce the metaphor of bridges, which fits naturally to the river metaphor.",,,,
4.2 Comparison Design The design includes two main components: a river and bridges.,,,,
Two distinct colors are assigned to indicate the two data streams and their items.,,,,
"The two sides of the river are line charts showing the evolution of a numeric characteristic, such as the volume, of the two data streams.",,,,
"Between the river sides, there are multiple bridges connecting the corresponding parts, according to the time or sequential steps, of the two data streams.",,,,
The bridge interior is used to visualize items from two data streams aggregated over the respective time or sub-sequence of steps.,,,,
The bridge interior is divided into blocks representing different items.,,,,
"The size of an item block encodes the frequency of the appearance of this item, the degree of item involvement in each stream, or other numeric information concerning the item.",,,,
"To simplify the description, we shall mainly refer to item frequencies.",,,,
"Each item block has two color regions, encoding the item frequencies in the corresponding stream.",,,,
"The order in which the items are put on a bridge is calculated based on Tisa ??Tisb , where Tis is the frequency of the item i in the data stream sa or sb in the selected period.",,,,
Such ordering puts items that are more prominent in one of the data streams nearer to the corresponding side of the river.,,,,
"For equal values, secondary ordering is based on times of their appearance in the data streams.",,,,
"Thus, to enable assessment of frequency differences (C2), 3 visual variables are used: position (order), color and size.",,,,
"The width of a bridge (in the 2D visualization, refers to the vertical length of a bridge) encodes the accumulated frequency of the items.",,,,
"On a bridge, depending on its width, there can be one or multiple lanes of items.",,,,
"Items can be separated into different lanes based on selected attributes, or the lanes can be used for showing more items without occlusions.",,,,
"There is a bar in the corner of each side of the bridge, which can be customized for showing value statistics of some numeric attributes for the period the bridge corresponds to.",,,,
"The time or sequence length is equally distributed among the bridges, but each bridge has a different width proportional to the combined stream volumes.",,,,
"To mark the exact time range, there are two gray curved lines linking the bridge sides to the accurate temporal or sequential positions on the river banks, The appearance of these visual elements fi,ts th,e bridge,""metaphor.,""",,,,
"The two sides of the trapezoid of the bridge imitate the shape of the river banks, thus depicting local trends, increase or decrease.",,,,
We summarize how our Co-Bridges design supports the comparison tasks.,,,,
??River sides: Visualizing and comparing numeric dynamic features of two streams.,,,,
The line plots making the river sides represent the evolution of a quantitative aspect of the data streams (T1).,,,,
Multiple-level zooming along the banks enables comparisons at multiple levels of granularity (T2).,,,,
??Bridges: Visualizing and comparing multi-item features.,,,,
??Qualitative comparison of the presence of items in the two streams is supported by showing the item labels (T3).,,,,
"??Quantitative comparison is supported by employing the sizes and positions of the item blocks, the heights of the curves, and the height of the bars on the bridges (T4).",,,,
"??Visual summary: To support the comparison of comparisons, several Co-Bridges are laid out side by side as small multiple displays (T5) (Figure 1).",,,,
"In the social media example, (Figure 3b), we processed 3,416 tweets from Hillary Clinton (indicated by pink) and Donald Trump (blue) in the 2016 presidential election in the USA.",,,,
Each bridge corresponds to one week.,,,,
We have selected the sub-streams containing tweets including the keyword ?쐅reat??,,,,
The visualization shows the contextual keywords (items) used in the texts.,,,,
The line plots (river sides) show the amounts of the tweets mentioning ?쐅reat??,,,,
"On most bridges, the keyword ?쐅reat??is laid out at the Trump's side, which indicates that Trump used this word more often than Clinton.",,,,
The width of the bridge near Jul.24 indicates that more tweets concerning ?쐅reat??were posted in that week.,,,,
We set the heights of the black bars on the bridges to show the counts of the followers who liked the tweets in the corresponding periods.,,,,
We can see that Trump's tweets got more ?쐋ikes??,,,,
"4.3 Parameter Setting In our Co-Bridges design, four main parameters affect the visual appearance and possibilities for comparison.",,,,
Granularity of time.,,,,
Users can customize the granularity based on the defined tasks (e.g.,,,,
Figure 7 ??daily).,,,,
We propose an automatic granularity setting method based on an empirical parameter of how \x0cmany bridges are shown at the same time.,,,,
This parameter affects the overall visual appearance and the expressiveness of each bridge.,,,,
We found 5 ??25 bridges to be a good default setting.,,,,
"In our evaluation study, we tested two examples with the number of bridges 9 and 20, and both worked well.",,,,
"Were there too many bridges, the details on each bridge could not be clearly shown.",,,,
"With too few bridges, too many items would be aggregated.",,,,
"Thus, we choose the granularity of time that gives a moderate number of bridges.",,,,
Number of extracted items.,,,,
"Due to space restriction, it is not possible to show hundreds or thousands of items at the same time.",,,,
"We let Co-Bridges show the items with top frequencies, assuming that such items are more important than others.",,,,
The frequency threshold needs to be adapted to the specific properties of available data.,,,,
"Thus, in the social media example, we show the top 10% of the items according to their frequencies.",,,,
The number of visible labels.,,,,
"Each item has a descriptive label: keyword, action name, entity name, event category, etc.",,,,
"Showing too many labels will result in visual clutter and occlusions, which will hinder the user's perception.",,,,
"We, therefore, determine the space available for the label in each item block on a bridge and show the label when the space in this block, possibly, combined with unused spaces in the neighbouring b,locks,"", is suff"",""icient.,""",,,,
The labels that would overlap with others are hidden.,,,,
More labels are displayed when a bridge is wider and thus provides more space.,,,,
"In this case, the labels are put in different vertical positions.",,,,
Selection of colors.,,,,
We select colors with a strong contrast to ensure that data items are visually distinguishable.,,,,
"4.4 Design Alternatives In the process of designing CO-Bridges, we propose several design alternatives for identify the design trade-offs.",,,,
One choice is a ?쐓ide-byside themerivers?? which may not optimal for comparing items in two rivers.,,,,
"Thus, we build up the structure of two histogram lines in two sides for comparison.",,,,
We consider design alternatives in two levels: the overall layout and the item-wise comparison.,,,,
"marks (i.e., the bars) representing the items become too small to discern and to compare the item frequencies in the streams.",,,,
We performed a user evaluation for comparing the effectiveness of this design to that of Co-Bridges.,,,,
The study is described in Section 7.,,,,
"Our evaluation results indicate that, generally, Co-Bridges is more effective than the alternative for comparison tasks.",,,,
(a) (b) (c) Fig.,,,,
5,,,,
Illustration of item-wise comparison alternatives: (a) Juxtaposition; (b) Superposition; and (c) Explicit encoding.,,,,
Item-wise comparison.,,,,
"In an item block, the two color sections corresponding to the two data streams can be put together in different ways.",,,,
The users are supposed to compare the sizes of these sections.,,,,
"According to [28], there are generally three approaches to supporting comparison: juxtaposition, superposition, and explicit encoding of differences or relationships.",,,,
"In application to the color blocks, these approaches can be described as follows.",,,,
"??Juxtaposition puts two color sections side by side, which is the design we choose.",,,,
The advantage of the juxtaposition is that both the individual frequencies of the item in the two data streams and the total frequency of the item can be clearly seen (Figure 5a).,,,,
??Superposition better shows the difference between the frequencies but lacks the capability to show the overall frequency of an item (Figure 5b).,,,,
"When the smaller section is shown in a semi-transparent mode, the color fusion can lead to visual clutter.",,,,
"??Explicit encoding can facilitate assessing the difference; (Figure 5c) however, the use of additional marks complicates the appearance.",,,,
These marks would be hardly discernible in the ?쐓mall multiples??mode used for the ?쐁omparison of comparisons??operation.,,,,
"Therefore, we avoid additional encoding of the differences, which would complicate the design.",,,,
We conclude that the design of Co-Bridges is more suitable for our purposes than the two-level design alternatives.,,,,
"5 I NTERACTIVE V ISUAL C OMPARISON In this section, we propose a workflow for the interactive visual comparison by means of Co-Bridges (Figure 6).",,,,
"To illustrate the supporting functions, we have implemented a visual analytics system (Figure 3) customized to Twitter Data.",,,,
Users??comparison strategy (Section 3.3) is supported through the visual exploration workflow.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
4,,,,
An alternative for the overall layout.,,,,
"The positions along the X-axis correspond to items, and the Y-axis represents time.",,,,
Overall layout.,,,,
"In our alternative design, the line plots are put on the sides, so that the space in the middle can be utilized for item comparison (Figure 4).",,,,
"The vertical axis represents time, and the items are laid out along the horizontal dimension in the same way as in Co-Bridges, based on the accumulated differences between the item frequencies in th,e two,streams.,"",""",,,,
"The items are represented by segmented vertical bars, such that the heights of the segments are proportional to the frequencies of the item appearance in the respective streams.",,,,
"There are the following differences of the alternative design from the Co-Bridges: 1) The items are laid out globally while Co-Bridges layout the items locally, i.e., on each bridge independently.",,,,
"2) In the design alternative, the items can be easier compared among different time periods, but the efficiency of the space usage is low.",,,,
"The visual 5.1 Comparison Entry: Sub-stream Selection At the beginning of a session, Co-Bridges show an overview of all data.",,,,
The bridges accommodate the items with the highest frequencies in the whole dataset (C1).,,,,
"For a more detailed exploration, users need to select subsets of the data, further referred to as sub-streams (C3).",,,,
"We provide three ways to enable users to select sub-streams for comparison: textual query, item graph node selection, and iterative attribute-based filtering applied to the currently explored (sub)s,""et.,"",,",,,,
These three ways complement each other and provide exploration flexibility for the users.,,,,
"The first way is the textual query tool, which provides an input box for users to type in the expected item labels.",,,,
Suggestions and auto-completion based on processed items will pop up to help users better search for appropriate items.,,,,
The textual query is a classical way of item selection.,,,,
The advantage is that the textual query provides a comprehensive entrance that any words in the data can be queried.,,,,
Another advantage is that such tools are quite familiar to users.,,,,
The drawback is that users may not know what items to search for.,,,,
The second way is aimed to compensate for the latter drawback of the use of a textual query.,,,,
We create a graph display of the items and their co-occurrence relationships (Figure 3a).,,,,
Each node represents an item.,,,,
The size and/or color of a node can encode item-related information.,,,,
"In particular, the node size can encode the overall frequency, and colored segments can represent the frequencies in the two streams.",,,,
A link between two nodes indicates the co-occurrence relationship between two items.,,,,
"If two items occur together more often, their positions \x0cFig.",,,,
6,,,,
Visual comparison workflow.,,,,
Iterative visual exploration is supported and Comparison-of-Comparisons provide further insight.,,,,
will be closer in the force-directed layout.,,,,
"The rationale for showing co-occurrences is that they are likely to reflect important relationships among items, which may inform and guide users??selections.",,,,
"To avoid clutter, we apply a collision detection and resolving technique for both labels and nodes.",,,,
Users can select nodes by clicking or brushing to select the sub-streams containing the corresponding items for comparison.,,,,
The graph view can be customized for different applications.,,,,
"In the social media example, we construct a graph of keywords appearing in the texts (Figure 3a) and, additionally, a graph of hashtags (words starting with #) and a graph of usernames mentioned in,the t,exts (wor,""ds starting with @).,""",,,,
"Third, users can employ an attribute-based filter, in which any attributes available in the data can be used.",,,,
"Generally, the design of the attribute-based filtering tool is application-dependent (it depends on the attributes present in the data).",,,,
"However, there is a common operation: selection of items shown on the bridges for iterative comparison (S2).",,,,
"In response, the sub-streams involving the selected items are shown, and the other items related to the selected items can be seen.",,,,
This feature encourages users to explore relationships between items.,,,,
"5.2 Detail-level Visual Comparison At this level, the user performs detailed comparison of two selected sub-streams.",,,,
Both the visual design and interaction facilities work together to achieve the comparison tasks.,,,,
"In Co-Bridges, users can observe the overall temporal pattern by scanning sequentially along the river direction (S1).",,,,
"Peaks and general trends are reflected in the shapes of the river sides, i.e., the line plots.",,,,
"For example, in Figure 3b), users can compare the trends of the substreams containing the item ?쐅reat??",,,,
"There are two large peaks on the left (Hillary Clinton), whereas Trump (on the right) consistently posts more tweets containing ?쐅reat??",,,,
"To investigate more details, users can brush a time period along the river side.",,,,
We provide semantic zooming that exposes more details in a finer granularity of time.,,,,
"In the same example, users brush the time period from Aug.22 to Sep.18.",,,,
The zoomed Co-Bridges view shows the temporal patterns with the data aggregated by days (Figure 7).,,,,
"More details are revealed: in some days (e.g. Aug.29, 31), Clinton also mentioned ?쐅reat??several times.",,,,
"To further support interactive qualitative and quantitative comparison, we provide, additionally to the visual encoding, highlighting and selection functions.",,,,
"When a user hovers an item, the same item appearing in other time periods will be highlighted with a red stroke, which helps users see the variation of the item's frequencies and relative positions,over,differen,""t bridges.,""",,,,
Quantitative information about the item also pops up.,,,,
Items shown in Co-Bridges are also selectable.,,,,
"As described previously, selection of an item results in selecting sub-streams of data containing this item.",,,,
"For the selected sub-streams, an additional instance of Co-Bridges is created.",,,,
"Multiple instances of Co-Bridges shown simultaneously serve as visual summaries of pair-wise similarities and differences, supporting the exploratory operation ?쐁omparison of comparisons??",,,,
Fig.,,,,
7,,,,
"By brushing a time period, users can conduct semantic zooming to examine finer patterns with smaller temporal granularity.",,,,
"5.3 Visual Summary Level: Comparison of Comparison When users select different sub-streams for detailed comparison, they can put interesting instances of Co-Bridges into the Comparison of Comparison,view,(Figure,""1).,""",,,,
This view contains the small multiples of the visual comparison summaries for different pairs of sub-streams (S3).,,,,
"In this way, the users can compare the similarity-difference patterns shown by the visual summaries.",,,,
A text above each Co-Bridges instance indicates the criterion by which the sub-streams were selected.,,,,
"The possible patterns that can be compared include: (1) Dominating items for one side; (2) Items with significant quantitative difference; (3) Items co-occurring with distinct contextual items; (4),Items,with dif,""ferent temporal patterns of appearance.,""",,,,
"For example, in Figure 1, we can see the following differences: (1) Only Trump mentioned ??AmericaFirst?? and he mentioned it as a slogan.",,,,
"(2) Clinton mentioned ?쐄amilies??more often, and Trump liked to say ?쐅reat??",,,,
"These words are mostly put on one or another side, which highlights the difference.",,,,
(3) Concerning the item ?쏛merica?? both politicians mentioned it quite frequently.,,,,
"Clinton mentioned it slightly more frequently and often in connection to words like ?쐅un?? ?쐏eople?? etc, while Trump preferred to use keywords ?쐅reat??and ?쏮akeAmericaGreatAgain??",,,,
"(4) The temporal pattern of Trump's ??AmericFirst??is different from others, with a gap at Jul.24 and late August.",,,,
The ?쏞omparison of comparisons??view is linked to the detailed comparison view.,,,,
"Users can brush the time in the detailed view, and the small multiples will be updated to show the selected time interval in more detail.",,,,
"When users highlight items in one Co-Bridges instance, the occurrences of the same items in other instances will also be highlighted to help users see similarities and differences in the times, freq,uenci,""es, and c"",""o-occurrences with other items.,""",,,,
This helps users connect information pieces from multiple views.,,,,

Comparative exploration of the tweets of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the U.S Presidential Election Campaign of 2016.,,,,
We investigate the virtual battle between them looking at the sub-streams containing the items (a) ?쏡onald??and (b)?쏞linton??,,,,
"From the discussion overview of ?쏡onald??, we iteratively explore how Clinton ?쏿ttacked??Donald on (a1) ?쐔ax??and (a2) ?쏱ence??issues as well as Trump's ?쐂efence??",,,,
From the discussion overview of ?쏞linton?? we identified (b1) Trump's ?쏿ttack??with words like ?쏞rooked??and ?쏞NN??as well as (b2) Clinton's defence.,,,,
Interesting patterns can thus be derived from Comparison of Comparisons.,,,,
"multiples based on different criteria, e.g. accumulated difference of the items, is provided.",,,,
5.4 Iterative Exploration The combination of the visual displays and interaction facilities enables high flexibility in comparing the data streams.,,,,
We support multiple ways of selecting sub-streams to be compared.,,,,
Users can refine the exploration through further selections within already selected sub-streams and/or by focusing on smaller time intervals.,,,,
"In the ?쏞omparison of comparisons??view (Figure 1), visual summaries can be added, deleted, and updated according to the user's current interests.",,,,
"In the iterative process, various insights can be derived by exploring different aspects of the data streams (Figure 8).",,,,
"6 G ENERALIZATION S TUDY To test the generality of the Co-Bridges design and approach to comparative exploration, we apply it to two example datasets: texts from social media and events that happene,d in,a footbal,""l game.,""",,,,
We test whether Co-Bridges can enable us to obtain interesting findings.,,,,
"6.1 Social Media Comparison With Co-Bridges, we have found several interesting patterns by comparing the tweets of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in their presidential election campaign of 2016 (F,igure,""8).,"",",,,,
"From the overview, we find that ?쏡onald??and ?쏞linton??were mentioned frequently by Clinton and Trump, respectively.",,,,
It indicates that they commented and criticized each other.,,,,
We are curious about what they usually said when they mentioned their opponent's name.,,,,
CoBridges provides two comparative overviews for the items ?쏡onald??(Figure 8a) and ?쏞linton??(Figure 8b).,,,,
In the texts related to ?쏡onald?? words from the Clinton's texts dominated.,,,,
The words ?쏷ax?? ?쏱eople?? and ?쏱ence??were frequently mentioned.,,,,
We select ?쏷ax??and find that Clinton continuously criticized Trump's ?쐔ax plan?? which is good for the wealthy people.,,,,
"Besides, Clinton challenged Trump's tax declaration (Figure 8-a1).",,,,
"By exploring ?쏱ence?? we found that Clinton criticized Pence for being anti-women, anti-LGBTQ, anti-immigrant, etc.",,,,
(Figure 8-a2).,,,,
Trump somehow tried to ?쐄ight back??by using ?쏷rumpPence16?? signifying the close collaboration between Pence and him.,,,,
"By semantically zooming in to the daily level, we find that on Jul.23 Clinton criticized Pence for slashing education funding.",,,,
"In the texts related to ?쏞linton??(Figure 8b), not only Trump mentioned Clinton many times, but also Clinton herself mentioned this item frequently in the weeks around Jul.24.",,,,
"Different from the ?쐓oft??words Clinton used, Trump used the words like ?쐁rooked??and ?쐀ad??in relation to Clinton and CNN.",,,,
He even created a hashtag ??CrookedHillary??(Figure 8b1).,,,,
"For the Clinton's side, we are curious how she defended herself when mentioning her name.",,,,
We drill down to the week around Jul.24.,,,,
"We find that Clinton was re-posting the messages praising herself from other social media users or media accounts, e.g. Potus, with most of the words being good (Figure 8b2).",,,,
"In this case, we compared the text streams of Clinton and Trump regarding multiple discussing issues and different levels of time gran- \x0cularity.",,,,
The iterative exploration and ?쏞omparison of comparisons??enabled us to compare multiple aspects of the two data streams.,,,,
"6.2 Football Event Sequence Comparison In this example, we apply Co-Bridges to compare the sequences of events that happened during a football match under the ball possession by two opponent teams.,"","",,",,,,
Our example dataset describes the game of Brazil vs. Belgium in the World Cup 2018.,,,,
"The event records include two kinds of items: action types (shooting, passing, etc.)",,,,
and the names of players who performed the actions.,,,,
We select the sub-streams consisting of the recorded shooting events (not necessarily successful) by an attribute-based filter.,,,,
Figure 9-left illustrates the comparison of the event sequences between the teams.,,,,
Brazil is encoded in pink and Belgium in blue.,,,,
The final result of the game was Brazil 1:2 Belgium.,,,,
"Among the scores, there was an own-goal of Brazil.",,,,
"Our session of comparative exploration includes the following activities and respective findings: ??Exploration of different stages of the game: In general, there were more shooting attempts from th,e Bra,""zil side,"",""but in some time periods, e.g. around 2:45, Belgium shot more times.,""",,,,
??Qualitative and quantitative item comparison: We see most of the actions co-occurring with the shots are passing actions.,,,,
"Douglas Costa and Neymar were among the major players related to shooting (i.e., they shot or assisted) in Brazil.",,,,
"On the Belgium side, De Bruyne was related to most of the shooting actions.",,,,
??Item comparison in different times: We can compare the dynamics of shooting-related players and actions at different times.,,,,
Neymar was more active in the first quarter and the last quarter of the game.,,,,
Douglas was especially active and involved in multiple shots during 3:00-3:15.,,,,
We can also identify time periods with specific features.,,,,
"For example, at 2:05-2:15, there was a high number of distinct Belgian players involved in shots.",,,,
The possibility of applying the approach to different kinds of data signifies its generality.,,,,

Datasets: We chose the Twitter data and the football data described in Section 6.,,,,
"The twitter data has a larger number of items, and they are more diverse (words), while the football data has fewer items and a smaller number of item types (events and players).",,,,
"In the Twitter data, we select all Hillary Clinton's and Donald Trump's Tweet data sub-streams involving ?쐅reat??(Figure 3b).",,,,
"In the football data, we select the sub-streams containing the ?쐓hots??events (Figure 9).",,,,
"To ensure a fair comparison, we controlled the aggregation level, showing the labels at the same aggregation level for Co-Bridges and the baseline visualization.",,,,
Procedure and Tasks: The participants were randomly divided into two equal size groups.,,,,
All participants were presented a video tutorial explaining the Co-Bridges and the baseline visualization.,,,,

"For each dataset, we conducted a between-subject study for evaluating the accuracy and completion time of their corresponding tasks.",,,,
We developed an interactive drag-and-drop environment for the user study (Figure 9).,,,,
"In this environment, each participant gets an image of the visualization to evaluate with only the hovering function and a list of tasks.",,,,
"Each task has a label 1, 2, 3 .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
8,,,,
"To answer the tasks, the participants needed to drag these labels to the corresponding parts of the visualization in the provided image, according to their understanding of the tasks.",,,,
"We evaluate answers by comparing them to the available ground truth, thus assessing users??understanding of the visualization.",,,,
"In a few cases of ambiguity, we verified answers with the participants.",,,,
"We record the accuracy and completion time of this process, which reflect participants??understanding and usage of the visualization.",,,,
We also provide an example for the participants (e.g.,,,,
Figure 9 ??task0).,,,,
"For this study, we presented four settings across two groups of users (two visualizations 횞 two datasets).",,,,
"There are eight concrete tasks for each dataset, based on the general tasks T1 - T4 in Section 3.1.",,,,

"[\x04 draws continuous attention, and the semantic summary of event]",,,,
[\x04 are modeled by analyzing cluster \x04.,,,,
3.4.1 Temporal Influence Definition 3 (Temporal Influence).,,,,
The temporal influence of event],,,,
"[\x04 , within particle time zone \x02, is defined as the number of \x04 0 s documents that fall into the particle time zone \x02 and is denoted by f챨]",,,,
[\x04 ; \x02횧.,,,,
"We assume that the more significant an event is, the more documents will be published to report and discuss it.",,,,
"In other words, significant events will have big temporal influences.",,,,
"Thus, temporal influence can help user identify significant events.",,,,
"3.4.2 Semantic Summary The semantic content of a temporal-locality cluster provides clues to the answer of ?쐗hat happened in the mapped event.??EventRiver summarizes the semantics of the cluster an,d use,s them to,""annotate the event.,""",,,,
"The document vectors in a cluster usually involve a large number of keywords, each of which has its specific weight in representing the semantics of the cluster.",,,,
"Therefore, it is inappropriate to indifferently use all the keywords to describe the event.",,,,
We propose a dual labeling approach to depict the semantics of the event.,,,,
"To begin with, we define two concepts.",,,,
Definition 4.,,,,
The Intra-Link Co-Strength ILC챨ki ; kj 횧 between keyword ki and kj in a temporal-locality cluster is the number of its documents in which ki and kj co-occur.,,,,
Definition 5.,,,,
"The Intra-Link Strength, or strength for short, of keyword ki in a temporal-locality cluster is defined as P ILS챨kj 횧 쩌 kj 2U k ;kj 6쩌ki ILC챨ki ; kj 횧, where U k is the union of all keywords u,sed t,o charact,""erize documents in the cluster.,""",,,,
k The strength of each keyword in U is calculated.,,,,
The keywords with high strengths and low strengths are used to represent the semantics of the event.,,,,
The keywords with high strengths are the most shared keywords in the cluster and describe the semantic context of the event.,,,,
They are named Context-Keywords of the event.,,,,
The keywords with low strengths convey unique contents in the event and are named Core-Keywords of the event.,,,,
"Assuming that the distribution of keywords is normal, we set the thresholds for context-keywords and core-keywords as \x06 첸 \x07 and \x06 \x02 \x07, respectively, where \x06 and \x07 are the mean,and s,tandard d,""eviation of the keyword strengths, respectively.,""",,,,
"The semantic representation of an event is the combination of the context-keywords and the core-keywords, and thus called dual labels.",,,,
3.5 Cluster Group Construction Clusters are organized into cluster groups \x04ig 챨i 쩌 0; 1; .,,,,
.,,,,
".횧 using an algorithm similar to the SPC algorithm, where clusters replace subclusters and cluster groups replace clusters.",,,,
We also define the group time horizon \x02ig as the union of the particle time zones covered by any cluster in \x04ig .,,,,
Cluster groups are updated after each run of SPC.,,,,
The similarity between two clusters is calculated based on their context-keywords using the Jaccard Coefficient.,,,,
"A cluster group is considered an Outlier if it meets one of the following criteria: 1) it contains only one cluster (i.e., the event has no related events); 2) there are more than one cluster in the,grou,""p, but al"",""l the clusters only occupy the same single particle time zone (i.e., the events do not receive continuous attention).,""",,,,
"In the rest of this paper, cluster groups refer to groups that are not outliers.",,,,
4 VISUALIZATION AND INTERACTIONS Semantics and time are two key aspects to the understanding of a real life event [3].,,,,
"To narrow the world view gap for event-related tasks, it is desired to intuitively present the events, their semantics, temporal information, and influences in a temporal context provided by the oth,er ev,ents to t,""he users so that they can browse events and retrieve events of interest.,""",,,,
"It is also important to reveal longterm stories consisting of related events and to visually present their narrative arcs to the users, so that they can discover high level stories and trace event e,volut,""ion.,"",",,,,
"Furthermore, the users should be allowed to retrieve and investigate stories and events of interest effectively and efficiently even when the text collection explored is large.",,,,
The visualizations and interactions in EventRiver are designed targeting at the above goals.,,,,
4.1 Visualization Design EventRiver visually presents events and long-term stories to the users.,,,,
"First, the events are displayed as bubbles whose sizes preattentively represent the temporal influences of the events.",,,,
"Second, the colors and layouts of the bubbles highlight long-term stories consisting of related events in a temporal context.",,,,
"Third, the semantics of the events and stories are displayed in their semantic representations.",,,,
4.1.1 Visual Representation of Events As shown in Fig.,,,,
"3, EventRiver displays an event as a bubble in a river of time.",,,,
"The horizontal dimension of a bubble represents the time span when it draws continuous attention, namely the life span of the mapping cluster.",,,,
Its changing vertical dimension represents its temporal influence in terms of the number of documents reporting or discussing it (refer to Section 3.4).,,,,
"By comparing the sizes of different bubbles, users can find events that received most significant attention since their bubbles are bigger and longer than the other bubbles.",,,,
"Thus, this design benefits event-related tasks such as event browsing and retrieval.",,,,
The curved outline of a bubble is a smoothed approximation of a set of rectangles as illustrated in Fig.,,,,
3,,,,
The rectangles depict temporal influence f챨\x08\x04 ; \x02횧 of event \x08\x04 .,,,,
Each rectangle corresponds to the particle time zone \x02 covered by \x04.,,,,
Its width 챨w횧 represents l\x02 and its height 챨h횧 represents f챨\x08\x04 ; \x02횧.,,,,
The curve boundaries of the bubbles are the Cubic Spline Interpolation of these rectangles.,,,,
"4.1.2 Visual Representation of Long-Term Stories A long-term story, story for short, consists of events mapped to clusters in the same cluster group.",,,,
We thus assign the same color to their bubbles to emphasize their \x0crelationships.,,,,
Different colors are assigned to different stories to distinguish them from each other.,,,,
All outliers (refer to Section 3.5) are colored in dark gray to reduce color clutter on the screen.,,,,
"In addition, the bubbles are laid out in a river like display (see Fig.",,,,
1) to show the narrative arcs of the stories in a temporal context.,,,,
The horizontal axis of the display is a time axis flowing from left to right.,,,,
The bubbles are positioned along the time axis according to the time spans their clusters cover.,,,,
Users can thus observe the temporal influence of an event in a context consisting of other events in the same story and other stories.,,,,
The vertical positions of the bubbles distinguish different stories.,,,,
Four rules are followed in the vertical position assignment: Events belong to the same story should be adjacent in their vertical positions to reveal their relationships.,,,,
2,,,,
"The more important a story is, the higher its vertical position.",,,,
"Thus, the reading manner of human beings, which is usually from top to bottom, can be supported.",,,,
"The importance of a story can be measured using different criteria, such as the number of related documents, the length, starting time, or ending time of its group time zone, or the maximum number o,f rel,ated docu,""ments in any particle time zone.,""",,,,
Users can interactively set the criterion.,,,,
3,,,,
"Within a story, the events are positioned one by one.",,,,
"The positioning priority from high to low is starting time, peak strength, and duration.",,,,
4,,,,
No overlaps are allowed among the bubbles.,,,,
The positioning algorithm is described as follows: 1. .,,,,
.,,,,
Step 1.,,,,
Put all cluster groups into a sorted queue where the one with large Importance (see rule 2 above) comes first into the queue.,,,,
Step 2.,,,,
Take the group at the front of the queue g ).,,,,
"Given the mapping relation (referred as \x04top between the clusters in the group and a couple of real life events, each of these events is placed into the g is a group's ?쐏layground.??The playgro,und o,f \x04top,""space whose horizontal dimension is confined by the g ; and its vertical dimension is group time zone \x02top ?쐆alf-open?? its upper boundary is the topmost g where position of the display area tailored by \x02top there are no other events placed underneath; and there is no constrain to the lowest vertical position.,""",,,,
The events are placed one by one into the playground in the positioning priority defined in rule 3.,,,,
Each event is placed at the highest possible vertical position within the playground without overlapping the settled events.,,,,
.,,,,
Step 3.,,,,
Repeat Step 2 until the queue of cluster groups is empty.,,,,
.,,,,
Step 4.,,,,
Insert the outlier events to the topmost unoccupied space one by one according to the same priority list used in settling events in the same story.,,,,
.,,,,
Step 5.,,,,
Scale the positions and the vertical sizes of all the events to fit them into the screen space.,,,,
The relative vertical sizes of the events are kept so that users can compare the temporal influences of different events.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
4 gives an example of the bubble layout.,,,,
"This figure proves that even with large number of bubbles, the narrative arcs of significant long-term stories (seen as the groups in yellow, in pink, in blue, and in red) are still well preserved i,n the,visualiz,""ation.,""",,,,
4.1.3 Semantic Representation The semantics of events are displayed as labels and snippets (see Fig.,,,,
5 for an example) in the visualization.,,,,
"An event is labeled by dual-labels, where core-keywords and contextkeywords (refer to Section 3.4) are displayed in parallel and in distinct background colors.",,,,
Dual labels help users learn the common theme in a long-term story and detect the unique content of the individual events.,,,,
"For example, Fig.",,,,
5 shows events in the long-term story about the 2006 Lebanon War with their labels displayed.,,,,
The labels in white background provide context information while the labels in yellow background display the unique content of each event.,,,,
They allow users to build a rough mental map of the long-term story without reading the documents.,,,,
Note that there are a few irrelevant keywords like ?쏧RANIAN??in the yellow labels.,,,,
They are introduced by errors in the segmentation of the closed caption documents.,,,,
"To reduce clutter, EventRiver provides a few automatic labeling strategies to selectively label the events.",,,,
"Representative event labeling automatically labels a representative event, such as the event mapped to the biggest cluster, for each story.",,,,
Outlier labeling labels outlier events only.,,,,
"In addition, when users zoom into a long-term story to \x0cexamine it in detail, all of its events will be automatically labeled.",,,,
Users can click on an event to manually turn on/ off its labels.,,,,
"When the labels do not fulfill the information needs of a user, the user can trigger the on-the-fly snippet by hovering the mouse over an event.",,,,
The snippet shows a few sentences from the documents in the cluster that contain one or more core-keywords and context-keywords.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
5 gives an example of the snippet.,,,,
.,,,,

.,,,,
.,,,,
Filtering-by-Influence?봘sers can set an influence range to hide events whose peak influences are out of the range.,,,,
Unhidden events are repositioned and proportionally deformed to fill the room made by hidden events.,,,,
"In this way, users can examine the major events driving the text without the distraction from the small ones, as shown in Fig.",,,,
1,,,,
Semantic Zooming?봘sers can use semantic zooming to remove unselected events from the screen and rescale the selected events to fulfill the screen.,,,,
"Meanwhile, the labels of the selected events will be automatically turned on.",,,,
Temporal Zooming?봘sers can brush the time axis to select a specific time period as a focus time slot.,,,,
This time slot will be rescaled to fulfill the horizontal screen space.,,,,
"Group Sorting?봘sers can sort the stories by a different importance criterion (refer to Section 4.1.2) and regenerate the vertical layout so that the stories considered more important will be displa,yed h,igher in,""the display.,""",,,,
Manual Relocation?봘sers can manually change the vertical positions of individual events to reduce overlaps among the labels.,,,,
.,,,,
Search-by-Keywords?봘sers can search events whose mapping clusters include/exclude any documents containing a few input keywords.,,,,
Users can type the keywords or select them from a preset keyword list (see Fig.,,,,
6a for an example).,,,,
"The list contains all the keywords used to characterize documents in the collection and can be sorted by different criteria, such as the total occurrences, the peak counts within the particle time z,""ones,"",and the,""first/last appearance time.,""",,,,
Search-by-Example?봘sers can interactively select an event and search all the events that share any core-keywords or context keywords with it.,,,,
"In this way, they can find associated events and track event evolution.",,,,
They can also search events by a piece of example text.,,,,
4.2.3 Interactions for Event Investigation Shoebox?봘sers can investigate an event by opening its shoebox with a mouse-click.,,,,
The shoebox allows the users to examine full details of the related documents and conduct investigative analysis (see Fig.,,,,
6b for an example).,,,,
Its interface consists of three components: .,,,,
.,,,,
"Index Panel lists all documents within the cluster, which can be sorted by their lengths, releasing time, or other criteria.",,,,
Typing a keyword in the search box will remove all documents with no occurrence of the keyword from the list.,,,,
Clicking a document in the list will load the document to the detail panel.,,,,
Detail Panel allows users to read a document in snippets or full text.,,,,
"In the snippet mode, only the \x0cFig.",,,,
6,,,,
Investigating the events about the 2006 Transatlantic Aircraft Plot.,,,,
The events in (a) were selected using the keyword Heathrow.,,,,

A storyboard for the story about the Ramsey Murder Case.,,,,
sentences containing core-keywords or context-keywords are displayed.,,,,
"In both modes, the keywords are highlighted by colors.",,,,
.,,,,
"Evidence Box allows users to save documents of interest into evidence files for external uses, such as evidence exchange or hypothesis evaluations.",,,,
Storyboard?봴sers can use a storyboard to examine all selected events at the same time to construct a metal map of the story consisting of these events.,,,,
It displays the events as an array of shoeboxes in chronological order.,,,,
See Fig.,,,,
7 for an example.,,,,
"5 CASE STUDY In this section, we present a few case studies.",,,,
"They show how EventRiver helps users quickly browse a large text collection for major driving events, track their evolution, and dive in an event for investigative analyses.",,,,
"The data \x0cexplored is CNN news from Aug. 1 to 24, 2006, containing 29,211 closed-caption documents.",,,,
"5.1 Case Study 1: Event Browsing In this case, we, without any prior knowledge, quickly browsed the major events and long-term stories that drive the news development.",,,,
"When the data set was opened in EventRiver, all events detected from it were displayed.",,,,
We interactively filtered out events with relatively low influences and labeled the representative events of the significant stories.,,,,
The resulting display is shown in Fig.,,,,
1,,,,
Several long-term stories stand out.,,,,
The story in red contains context-keywords ?쏧sraeli??and ?쏬ebanese??,,,,
"From the snippets, we learn that it is about the 2006 Lebanon War.",,,,
The story in blue has the context-keywords ?쏪onbenet Ramsey??and ?쏷hailand??,,,,
"From the snippets, we learn that it reports the new leads in the Jonbenet Ramsey Murder Case.",,,,
"Similarly, several other stories, such as the 2006 Transatlantic Aircraft Plot in green and Floyd Landis Drug Scandal of La Tour de France in pink, are detected.",,,,
"5.2 Case Study 2: Event Search, Tracking, and Association In this case, we took a closer look at the Jonbenet Ramsey Murder Case.",,,,
We selected all events in this story using the Search-by-Example interaction and opened a storyboard for them (Fig.,,,,
7).,,,,
In Fig.,,,,
"7, the snippets in shoeboxes exhibit the narratives of this story, starting with an motivating event on Aug. 16?붴쏷here's been an arrest in connection with the murder of Jonbenet Ramsey nearly te,n yea,rs ago at,""her home in Boulder, Colorado.??Then there were the followups of this event: Aug. 17, Karr admitted being in the company with Jonbenet when she was killed; the next day, Aug. 18, an e-mail written by Karr was revealed as a piece of importance evidence in this murder case; on Aug. 20, suspect John Karr was deported to the United States from Thailand for trial; Karr waived extradition in Los Angeles County Superior Court, clearing the way for his transfer to Boulder (CO) on Aug. 22; and Aug. 24, Karr retained his California attorneys for the upcoming trial in Boulder (CO).,""",,,,
5.3 Case Study 3: Event Investigation When we zoomed into the story of 2006 Transatlantic Aircraft Plot (see Fig.,,,,
"6a), we noticed that the keyword ?쐅el??appears in the labels of a few events.",,,,
We wondered how gel was related to this terrorism and clicked on an event with ?쐅el??in its label to open a shoebox (see Fig.,,,,
6b) to investigate it.,,,,
"In the shoebox, we searched documents containing ?쐅el??and learned that ?쐅el??had been listed as a suspicious and banned item in air flights to prevent the carrying of disguised liquid explosives.,"","",,",,,,
6 EXPERIMENT The effectiveness of EventRiver in supporting event-related tasks heavily depends on the quality of the temporallocality clusters.,,,,
Its scalability to large text collections is related to the time efficiency of the clustering algorithm.,,,,
We have conducted a set of experiments to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of this algorithm.,,,,
"6.1 Settings A real data set consisting of 29,211 closed-caption documents of CNN news from Aug. 1 to 24, 2006 was used in the experiment.",,,,
"On average, 9,092 keywords per day were used to characterize the documents.",,,,
EventRiver processed the data set on a PC with Intel Core 2 Duo processor and 2 GB memory.,,,,
"The parameters of the algorithms were set as follows: the length of particle time zone l\x02 쩌 24 h; a sampling rate of 10 percent was used in SPC Jaccard Coefficient calculation for subclusters an,d clu,sters who,""se sizes are larger than 10.,""",,,,
"Otherwise, the sampling rate is 100 percent.",,,,
"6.2 Time Efficiency The time of cluster extraction and cluster group construction for the whole text collection was 5 min and 13 s (i.e., 313 s), which means that it takes about 0.01 s to process th,e key,words of,""each document on average.,""",,,,
"In particular, given that the average size of a document batch is 1,221, the average processing time for one particle time zone, namely the average incremental processing time, was 13.064 s. The res,ults,showed th,""at the cluster extraction and group construction were time efficient.,""",,,,
6.3 Quality There were 363 events and 17 long-term stories discovered from the text collection (see Fig.,,,,
1).,,,,
A multiresolution approach was used to examine the results.,,,,
"First, to make sure that no major stories in the data set were missing in EventRiver, we visualized the same data set using IN-SPIRE [23] (see Fig.",,,,
8) and compared the stories discovered by EventRiver with the clusters revealed in IN-SPIRE.,,,,
INSPIRE clustered the whole text collection without considering the time stamps of the documents and displayed the clusters as mountains.,,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"8, IN-SPIRE revealed 18 significant clusters excluding the similar ones.",,,,
"Comparing them with the 17 stories discovered by EventRiver, we found that the two systems detected 15 topics in common.",,,,
"The two exclusive topics from EventRiver were ?쏤loyd Landis drug scandal of La Tour de France??and ?쐔he kidnap of the two journalists Olaf Wiig and Steve Centanni in Gaza.??By scanning the origina,l dat,""a set, we"",""were sure that both of them were significant topics.,""",,,,
"The three exclusive topics from IN-SPIRE were labeled as ?쐋arry, ve, didn?셳,???쐆ot, companies, women,??and ?쐋arry, ve, ricky, yeah.??After reading documents on these topics, we learned that ?쐋a,rry??,refers to,""the famous CNN anchor Larry King and the topics consist of several small events in Larry King's show.,""",,,,
"The topic ?쐆ot, companies, women??consists of a set of trivial daily news with these three words appearing prominently.",,,,
The results show that EventRiver captured the major stories from the text collection as effectively as or even better than IN-SPIRE.,,,,
EventRiver also exhibited significant advantages in visually depicting the narrative arcs of the stories in one view.,,,,
"IN-SPIRE depended on time slicing techniques to reveal the narratives, which was not efficient and suffered from change blindness [20].",,,,
"We next examined several long-term stories detected by EventRiver in detail by comparing their events with an external reference source, namely Wikipedia.org [22].",,,,
"Eight stories with the largest numbers of events were examined, \x0ceach of which was listed as one of the weekly top five most popular topics at CNN.com at least once for the time period during whi,ch it,occurred,"".,""",,,,
"In Wikipedia, the major events of these stories were manually summarized and listed as timelines.",,,,
"We believe that such human-generated summaries are usually more accurate than any automatic results, which make them a benchmark for evaluation.",,,,
"For each of the eight stories, we first manually compared their events discovered by EventRiver with the events listed in the Wikipedia timeline to identify matching events.",,,,
"Then, we measured the quality of EventRiver results against Wikipedia using precision [6], namely the ratio between the number of matching events and the total number of events of this story in Even,tRive,""r, and re"",""call [6], namely the ratio between the number of matching events and the total number of events in this story listed in the Wikipedia timeline.,""",,,,
This process is illustrated in the following example.,,,,
The scores of precision and recall are shown in Table 1.,,,,
"The 2006 Lebanon War?볾 Close Look at the Event Extraction Results Wikipedia has a timeline [22] for the military operations of the 2006 Lebanon War where 17 events are listed in the time period of,the e,xperiment,""data set.,""",,,,
"For EventRiver, there were 15 events in the story of the 2006 Lebanon War.",,,,
"Fourteen events matched, which led to a precision of 93.3 percent (14/ 15) and a recall of 82.4 percent (14/17).",,,,
Here we list a few example matching events.,,,,
"For each event, we cite the event description in Wikipedia and highlight the keywords appearing in the labels of the matching event in EventRiver in bold (see Fig.",,,,
"5 for the events, labels, and snippets in EventRiver): 1.",,,,
"On Aug. 4, ?쏧srael targeted the southern outskirts of Beirut, and later in the day, Hezbollah launched rockets at the Hadera region.",,,,
"Thirty three civilian farm workers are killed and 20 wounded after an Israeli airstrike in a farm near Qaa in Lebanon.??On Aug. 5, ?쏧sraeli commando soldiers landed in Tyre, where fighting erupted,with,Hezbollah,""forces.??3.,""",,,,
"On Aug. 6, ?쏷welve army reservists resting near the Lebanon border were killed in the deadliest barrage of Hezbollah rocket attacks so far.",,,,
Three Israeli civilians were also killed in a dusk attack in the port of Haifa.??A snippet of this event is shown in Fig.,,,,
5,,,,

"On Aug. 9, ?쐇n the eastern Bekaa Valley five people were reported killed and two feared dead after an Israeli airraid.??5.",,,,
"On Aug. 10, ?쏞ondoleezza Rice formally explains the resolution plan of the U.N. for reconciliation between Lebanon and Israel.??6.",,,,

The meaningful real life events discovered in the experiment also indirectly proved the effectiveness of the document generation model on which the event-based text analysis establishes itself.,,,,
"The analysis offered by EventRiver can scale up to much larger text collections with temporal references and can give overviews even when human analyses (demonstrated via Wikipedia here) have not be,en pe,rformed.,"",""",,,,
"Further, the temporal analysis approach provided in this paper is unique and gives EventRiver capabilities that other tools do not have.",,,,
2,,,,
7 PRELIMINARY USER FEEDBACKS We report user feedbacks from a preliminary user test of EventRiver.,,,,
This test was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of EventRiver in supporting the event-related tasks as a human-centered visual analytics solution.,,,,
We performed this test by comparing EventRiver \x0cwith LensRiver [12] (see Fig.,,,,
"9), which is a KeywordTracing Technique (refer to Section 2).",,,,
Our assumption was that the EventRiver was more effective in helping users discover major events and learn their semantic contents and evolution than Keyword Tracing Techniques such as LensRiver.,,,,
"To form a comparable study, labels and snippets were provided in both EventRiver and LensRiver.",,,,
The shoebox was disabled to make sure that users learned the semantics without reading the documents.,,,,
"CNN news from Aug. 1 to 24, 2006 was used in the formal test while CNN news from Sept. 1 to 15, 2006 was used in the training.",,,,
Each document is characterized by the same keyword vector in both systems.,,,,
Figs.,,,,
"1 and 9 show the test data sets in EventRiver and LensRiver, respectively.",,,,
"The test was a within-subjects, balanced user study.",,,,
Twelve graduate students majoring in computer science participated in this test.,,,,
All subjects claimed that they were unfamiliar with or forgot about the details about the news during Aug. 2006.,,,,
The subjects took the test one by one on the same desktop PC.,,,,
The procedure of this test was indicated as follows: Each subject worked through two sections.,,,,
"In each section, a subject was asked to complete the same set of tasks with either EventRiver or LensRiver.",,,,
Half of the subjects worked with EventRiver in the first section and with LensRiver in the second section.,,,,
Another half worked in reversed order.,,,,
We asked the subjects to use both systems to learn their preference.,,,,
"In our task performance statistics, only the results from the first section were calculated to avoid the case that what a subject learned from the first section helped him/her in the second section.,"","",,",,,,
"Each section started with a 10-min training period in which the instructor introduced the interface and the interactions to the subject and the subject freely explored the tool using the training da,ta se,""t.,"",",,,,
The instructor answered questions from the subject during the training.,,,,
The formal tasks followed the training.,,,,
It contained two tasks.,,,,
The first task tested how the visualization helped users discover significant events in the major stories that drive the text collection and learn their semantics.,,,,
"As shown in Table 2, two groups of hypothetical events were given and the subject was asked to judge whether each hypothetical event was true or false.",,,,
The subject was asked to rate his/her confidence about the judgment on a 1 (low confidence) to 5 (high confidence) scale.,,,,
The second task tested how the visualization helped users learn event evolution.,,,,
"As shown in Table 3, two groups of associated real life events were given and the subject was asked to number the chronological order of the events within each group.",,,,
The subject was again asked to rate his/her confidence about the answers on the same scale.,,,,
Note that all the events used in the tasks were based on news events that were listed in the weekly top.,,,,
The total time the subject used to finish each task was manually recorded by the instructor.,,,,
"After the test, the subjects were asked to complete a posttest questionnaire on their preference to EventRiver and LensRiver with regard to their usefulness, ease of use, and awareness of context.",,,,
Scales of 1 (low preference) to 5 (high preference) were used for the measure.,,,,
Free-style comments were also collected.,,,,
by users during their tasks) and design corresponding visualizations; .,,,,
"to design a dynamic visualization mechanism, which will seamlessly integrate with the current dynamic data procession mechanism, so that EventRiver can be applied to real-time text streams.",,,,
"In addition, EventRiver will be strengthened to support visual sense making better by integrating more analytical components such as opinion analysis.",,,,
We also plan to support comparative analysis of multiple text collections using EventRiver.,,,,
The results of this test are reported in Table 4.,,,,
"The results showed that EventRiver had advantages over LensRiver for the given tasks with regard to time efficiency, correctness, user confidence, and user preference on usefulness, ease of use, and,awar,eness of,""context.,""",,,,
Users commented that it was easy to find keywords associations and track event evolution using EventRiver.,,,,
"By contrast, users found that it was hard to find keyword associations from LensRiver, especially when the keywords under inspection had a relatively long life span.",,,,
"8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In conclusion, EventRiver advances analysis on text collections with temporal references in that: EventRiver exemplifies the integration of novel analytical components w,ith a,n express,""ive visual representation and interaction methods to visualize text collections in support of event-related analytical tasks.,""",,,,
The whole approach is established upon an event-based perspective so that the world view gap can be narrowed to a great extend.,,,,

.,,,,
EventRiver employs a novel event-based text analysis approach upon a streaming data model.,,,,
"Besides computational efficiency, this dynamic data process mechanism brings EventRiver the potential to be applied to real-time text stream applications in the future.",,,,

EventRiver employs a visualization that reveals the narrative arcs of a text collection in terms of events and offers intuitive visual clues with ready accessibility to full text.,,,,
"It also provides a multiresolution visual exploration pipeline from long-term stories, events, to full text of a document, which allows users to explore the text collection in a scalable and managea,ble w,""ay.,"",",,,,
"In the future, we are going to extend EventRiver in the following directions: .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
"to allow the individual user to influence the determination of importance of the events by feeding personal preferences into the system, particularly into the analytic part, and thus, to further nar,row t,he world,""view gap; to scale to larger text collections by enabling multiresolution temporal granularity and allowing user to interactively change the granularity (for example, the particle time zone can be dynamically adjusted ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This paper is partially supported by the US Department of Homeland Security under Grant Award Number 2008-ST108-000002 and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant number IIS-0915528.,""",,,,

"Visual Opinion Analysis of Customer Feedback Data ABSTRACT Today, online stores collect a lot of customer feedback in the form of surveys, reviews, and comments.",,,,

[9] reports that ??1% of Internet users (or 60% of Americans) have done online research on a product at least once??,,,,
"Furthermore, they state that customers are willing to invest significantly more for a 5-starrated product than a 4-star-rated product.",,,,
"Therefore, reviews can have a large impact on the profit margin that a company is able to realize with a specific product.",,,,
"While the internet users were generally satisfied with their online product research, ?쏿t the same time, 58% also report that online information was missing, impossible to find, confusing, and/or o,verwh,elming??,"",""",,,,
"[9] _____________________ Over the years, manufacturers and retailers alike have collected vast amounts of reviews from their customers.",,,,
"This feedback is a valuable source of information for a company to improve the quality of the products, correct service failures, and guide their customers.",,,,
"On the other hand, as the above cited surveys show, the customers themselves are also interested in this source of information to find the product that fits best to their needs.",,,,
"However, the feedback is unstructured by nature; there are too many customer comments to read them all sequentially.",,,,
It is timeconsuming to uncover the ?쐅olden nuggets??,,,,
"As a result, actionable insight is not readily available and much of the feedback is ignored.",,,,
Often customers are asked to give a total score (see e.g. the webpage of amazon.com).,,,,
"Yet, this score does not necessarily reveal the product's true quality and may provide misleading recommendations.",,,,
An attribute of a product that was important for customer A and thus had an important impact on the total score that this customer gave might be irrelevant for customer B.,,,,
"Thus, the latter does not mind if this feature is not available in the product or is deficient.",,,,
"Similarly, it is not enough for a company to know which of their products customers liked best or least.",,,,
In order to learn from the feedback and be able to improve the products they need to know which attributes of the product their customers liked and disliked.,,,,
"Also, for marketing purposes it is interesting to see which subgroups of customers with similar opinions exist.",,,,
1.2 Our goals and Contributions In this paper we present an approach to automatically analyze large volumes of customer reviews with respect to what was commented on positively or negatively.,,,,
"To achieve our goal, we developed a novel discrimination-based technique that detects automatically which product attributes were frequently commented on.",,,,
We then analyze for each attribute if it was mentioned positively or negatively.,,,,
"In contrast to other approaches, we determine an overall score for each attribute and each review since we are not only interested in a list of sentences that comment on a specific attribute positiv,ely o,r negativ,""ely but want to know the specific opinion of the customer.,""",,,,
"Furthermore, we present several novel visualization techniques that help the analyst to make use of the resulting structured but still large amount of data.",,,,
Our summary report visualization provides a quick overview.,,,,
In contrast to other visual summarization techniques it is scalable both with respect to the number of attributes and the number of products that are compared.,,,,
"In addition, we also developed a technique to analyze clusters of similar opinions in the data set.",,,,
Key to the detection of meaningful clusters is our distance function that is able to group reviews with similar patterns together.,,,,
The clusters themselves are visualized with special thumbnails that show what the reviews in the particular cluster have in common.,,,,
"Finally, our interactive circular correlation map allows analysts to detect relationships between the attributes and the user given scores.",,,,
The paper is structured as follows: In section 2 we give an overview of the whole visual analytics process.,,,,
Section 3 introduces the automatic techniques that are necessary to extract \x0cthe opinions from reviews.,,,,
"In section 4, we present our three visualization techniques.",,,,
This section also includes an application part in which real-world data is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.,,,,
An evaluation of the attribute extraction step and an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of our approach are then presented in section 5.,,,,
We end with a review of related work in section 6 and the conclusions.,,,,
2 OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS A schematic overview of our approach is given in Figure 1.,,,,
"The illustrated process can be subdivided into two main tasks: (a) The fully automatic analysis of the opinions mentioned in the reviews and (b) the visual analysis of the feature vectors that were,gener,ated base,""d on these automatically extracted opinions.,""",,,,
The process is designed as a pipeline.,,,,
This allows us to easily exchange single steps of the complex process.,,,,
"Task (a) is done in three steps: the extraction of the attributes that have been frequently commented on, the detection of opinion signal words, and finally the mapping of the attributes and opinion,s to,find out,""which opinion words refer to a specific attribute.,""",,,,
Note that with ?쏿ttributes??in this case we refer to the components or aspects of a specific product or type of product that are crucial when customers judge it.,,,,
"At the end of task (a) a feature vector is generated for each review which has one entry per attribute that can either be larger than 0 (if the attribute has been positively commented on), smaller t,han 0,(if it w,""as negatively mentioned) or 0 (if no opinion was expressed on the attribute in this review).,""",,,,
Task (b) deals with the analysis of the extracted feature vectors.,,,,
"As we will show, a combination of visual and automatic techniques is key to finding trends and patterns in the data.",,,,
"3 AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF ATTRIBUTES AND OPINIONS Given a collection of reviews our technique allows to automatically create one feature vector per review that reflects the opinion given in the revi,ew in,a detail,""ed, differentiated and comparable way.,""",,,,
The opinion of any significant product attribute is represented by one feature dimension.,,,,
The approach includes some data preprocessing steps outlined in section 3.1 and a novel technique for attribute extraction described in section 3.2.,,,,
"Then, section 3.3 deals with the detection of opinion signal word and section 3.4 describes the mapping between attributes and opinion signal words.",,,,
3.1 Data Preprocessing The attributes have to be extracted from plain text natural language reviews.,,,,
As a preprocessing step we apply a base form reduction algorithm to all words in order to get e.g. singular forms for nouns and infinitive forms for verbs.,,,,
In addition we use a sentence splitter and POS-tagger ([13]) as well as a NP-chunker ([11]) in order to identify noun phrases.,,,,
This allows us to consider noun phrases that consist of several consecutive words (tokens).,,,,
"Numbers and short strings with less than 3 characters are deleted in the preprocessing step since they often correspond to punctuation marks or special characters that do not need to be considered.,"","",,",,,,
3.2 Attribute Extraction The first step of our opinion analysis method is the extraction of attributes.,,,,
With attributes we refer to certain characteristics of the entity of interest which are frequently mentioned when this entity is evaluated.,,,,
"For a product those attributes may be components, properties or parameters that are important for customers when evaluating it.",,,,
"In our scenario, it is important to automatically detect a list of all relevant product attributes, since it allows us to analyze customer reviews not only with respect to their general evaluation,,but l,ook in de,""tail at the particular attributes that customers were satisfied with or complained about.,""",,,,
"A straightforward way to automatically extract these attributes out of textual data sources (such as reviews) would be to take the most frequent words and filter out stop words according to a given,stop,word list,"".,""",,,,
For our printer reviews from amazon.com this results in the list of the 40 most frequent terms that is shown in the upper part of Figure 2.,,,,
"The problem that comes along with this approach is that not only words describing product attributes like ?쐏rint??or ?쐓oftware??are frequent but also typical review terms like ?쐅reat?? ?쐋ike??or,?쐍e,""ed??,"",",,,,
"Widely used stop word lists contain only very general terms like conjunctions, determiners, pronouns etc.",,,,
and thus are not suitable to separate the printer terms from the rest.,,,,
We have to apply a special term filtering that extracts the printer terms while it does not consider the review terms.,,,,
"For this purpose, we developed a novel discrimination-based term extraction method: We consider the set of printer reviews to be a special class of text documents (?쐏rinter review class?? and compa,re it,to a set,""of reviews from amazon.com (e.g. book reviews) which we consider to be the counter-balance class (?쐀ook review class??.,""",,,,
"Now, the aim is to find the terms that are much more important within the class of printer reviews than within the class of book reviews.",,,,
We make use of the fact that both classes share the review-related vocabulary and extract the terms that discriminate the printer review class against the counter-balance class of book reviews.,,,,
By our definition a term discriminates one class from another if it is much more important within this class than within the other one.,,,,
"In order to measure the importance of terms for a class, we weight terms according to a \x0cnovel extension of the TFIDF-measure, our ?쏷erm Frequency Inverse Class Frequency??(TFICF).",,,,
We determine then the set of terms that discriminate the printer review class against the counter-balance class considering the TFICF term scores.,,,,
"TFICF ??Our Importance Measure The most popular approach for term scoring, TFIDF [12], is not suitable in this case.",,,,
This is due to the fact that the TFIDF value determines an importance value for a certain term with respect to a document within a document collection.,,,,
What we need is an importance value for a certain term with respect to a document class.,,,,
"Therefore, we introduce the TFICF, which is an extension of the classic TFIDF measure.",,,,
The formula for TFICF is composed of two factors: a term frequency value (tf) and an inverse class frequency value (icf).,,,,
The tf value reflects the relative frequency of a term within a class as in the TFIDF measure.,,,,
The icf value takes into account in how many classes the term is present.,,,,
In contrast to the standard idf formula our icf formula has to operate on multiple classes of documents instead of a single class.,,,,
"A straightforward application of the icf formula would be to say that a term t is an element of a class c, if it occurs in at least one of the corresponding documents.",,,,
"However, that means that outlier documents get a high influence on the result.",,,,
"Therefore, we propose to define that term t is only considered element of a class c if at least X percent of the documents D (where X is a user-defined parameter) contain the term (see equation 1).,"","",,",,,,
Extracting Discriminating Terms The TFICF measure provides a term weight that is comparable among several classes.,,,,
For each term we get one value per class that allows us to compare the importance of the term in the two classes.,,,,
We now define that a term is discriminating for one of these classes if its score is significantly higher for this class than its scores for the other classes.,,,,
"To determine the discriminating terms for a class, we use a threshold called discrimination factor by which a score for one class must outnumber the scores of all other classes (see definition 1).",,,,
"Definition 1: Discriminating terms Extracting printer attributes As mentioned before, for our scenario we used a counterbalance class containing book reviews and discriminated the printer review cla,ss ag,ainst it.,"",""",,,,
"As both classes shared the review specific terms, only printer related terms were discriminating the printer class and hence got extracted.",,,,
"Figure 2 compares the approach that just extracts the 40 most frequent terms after filtering stop words (top) with the result of our technique using the book reviews as a counter-balance class (bott,om).,"","",",,,,
It is easy to see that the quality of the second list is much higher since more product-related attributes are present.,,,,
"Thus, our approach allows us to do domain-specific term filtering without the usage of an ontology or a specialized knowledge base, just by providing a set of documents as counter-balance class.",,,,
"3.3 Detection of opinion signal words Once the attributes that were commented on have been identified, the aim is to find out what opinions were expressed on these attributes, respectively if the at,tribu,te was me,""ntioned negatively or positively.,""",,,,
To this end it is crucial to determine so called opinion signal words connoted with an attribute.,,,,
"These opinion signal words can have a positive polarity, e.g. ?쐗onderful??or ?쐔o like?? or they can express a negative connotation as for example ?쐀ad??or ?쐏roblem??",,,,
In order to find opinion signal words we used a freely available dictionary [1] listing words that evoke positive or negative associations.,,,,
All other words that were not contained in the word list were considered as neutral words.,,,,
"In addition, it is important to deal with the occurrence of negations.",,,,
"While the term ?쐅ood??for instance is clearly positive, the expression ?쐍ot good??is negative although it contains a positive opinion signal word.",,,,
"For the purpose of avoiding such misinterpretations a simple heuristic was introduced that inverts the polarity of an opinion signal word if a negation word is preceding within a short range of toke,""ns.,"",,",,,,
3.4 Mapping of attributes and opinion signal words Given the attribute terms and the opinion words next we determine for each attribute in a sentence which opinion word(s) refer to it.,,,,
We developed a novel statistical method that detects the opinion that has been expressed on an attribute by taking the polarity of the opinion signal words (os-words) around it into account.,,,,
We call our method Reverse-Distance-Weighting (RDW).,,,,
The basic assumption of RDW is that the closer an osword is to an attribute the higher is the probability that it refers to that attribute.,,,,
Please note that we constrain the search for oswords to the same sentence that the attribute is in.,,,,
Within a sentence a higher influence is given to closer os-words according to the reverse-distance weight (see equation 2).,,,,
A cutoff value is used to define how many words before and after the attribute are taken into account.,,,,
In our application the cutoff threshold was set to 4.,,,,
"Experiments showed that this cutoff value is especially important in long sentences, because it prevents errors that are caused by very distant os-words that are incorrectly mapped to the attribute.,"","",,",,,,
In order to get an opinion value for an attribute A and a sentence S equation 3 is applied.,,,,
The weighted polarity values for each osword o within S are summed up.,,,,
The polarity value of an os-word is either +1 or -1 depending on whether it is contained in the positive or negative word list.,,,,
"If an attribute A gets a positive opinion score, the sentence is interpreted as talking positively about the attribute.",,,,
"Likewise, if this sum is negative, the sentence is supposed to talk in a negative manner about the attribute.",,,,
"If the sum is equal to 0, the polarity of the closest os-word is decisive.",,,,
Our application is special in the sense that we do not only want to know whether an attribute was mentioned positively or negatively in a specific sentence.,,,,
Instead we are interested in the overall opinion that was expressed about the attribute in the review.,,,,
To get the opinion value for an attribute on the reviewlevel the majority vote of the sentence polarities for this attribute is determined.,,,,
As a result for every review we get a feature vector that summarizes the expressed opinions on the individual attributes.,,,,
For each attribute there is one feature dimension in the vector.,,,,
"The corresponding value of the vector for a particular attribute's \x0cdimension indicates whether the attribute was mentioned positively (+1), negatively (-1) or neutrally / not at all (0).",,,,
Figure 3.,,,,
Summary Report of printers: Each row shows the attribute performances of a specific printer.,,,,
Blue color represents comparatively positive user opinions and red color comparatively negative ones (see color scale).,,,,
The size of an inner rectangle indicates the amount of customers that commented on an attribute.,,,,
The larger the rectangle the more comments have been provided by the customers.,,,,
"4 APPLICATIONS AND VISUAL ANALYTICS METHODS The resulting multi-dimensional feature vectors are applied to real-world customer comments from an online store and product reviews from amazon.com to id,entif,y the str,""ength and problems of different products and services.,""",,,,
"We have introduced three new visual analytics techniques: (1) summary reports that provide a quick overview of the customer reviews without the need to read them, (2) a visualization of the clusters,of r,eviews in,""which similar opinions are expressed and finally (3) circular correlation maps to uncover correlations between the user-given score and different attributes.,""",,,,
4.1 Visual Summary Reports Visual summary reports provide a quick overview of the customer feedback data set.,,,,
They show for each attribute extracted by our automatic algorithm whether it belongs to the category of attributes with a positive tendency (blue) or the category with a negative tendency (red).,,,,
"The size of the inner rectangles is determined by the percentage of reviews that commented on the attribute signaling the importance that the analyst should give to this attribute in his or her eval,uatio,""n.,"",",,,,
"Color is mapped to the percentage of positive or negative opinions, respectively.",,,,
"Using our automatic analysis method, we calculate the average percentage of positive comments per attribute and use this as a threshold.",,,,
"Attributes whose percentage of positive comments is above that threshold exhibit a positive tendency compared to the other attributes (color = blue), the ones that are below the threshold show a neg,ative,tendency,""(color = red).,""",,,,
The stronger the positive or negative tendency is the darker the color value becomes.,,,,
The intervals for the four shades of blue / red tones are determined by the quantiles of the set of positive or negative attributes.,,,,
"By recalculating the threshold value for each data set instead of using a fixed one we compensate for the shift that is caused by the fact that some products are generally commented on more positive,ly th,an others,"".,""",,,,
Please note that the basis for the calculation of the threshold and the quantiles is always the whole set of product reviews that are displayed to ensure comparability across the different lines.,,,,
Figure 4.,,,,
"Scatterplot of customer reviews on printers: Seven main opinion clusters have been identified and mapped in a 2D space, each represented by one thumbnail.",,,,
"The more reviews a cluster contains, the larger its thumbnail is displayed.",,,,
"Positive opinions are highlighted in shades blue, the negative ones accordingly in red.",,,,
The color brightness is mapped to the percentage of reviews within a cluster that share a certain opinion.,,,,
Figure 3 shows a visual summary report of reviews from amazon.com on three different printers (in total 1876 reviews were analyzed).,,,,
For printer 1 we additionally show the result for two different printer types separately.,,,,
This allows a detailed analysis of strength and weaknesses of specific printer families.,,,,
It can be seen that there are some attributes that the customers are generally satisfied with.,,,,
"This is true for the general attribute \x0c?쐏rinter??but also for other attributes such as ?쐁opy, photo, print or quality??",,,,
The latter ones suggest the assumption that the quality of the prints is not that much of a distinguishing factor between the different brands.,,,,
On the other hand we found that there is a lot of negative feedback for the attributes ?쐁artridge?? ?쐇nk?? ?쐌onth?? ?쐓oftware??and ?쐕nit??,,,,
"Of course, such attribute terms can only be considered as hints that point at certain problems that the analyst should have a closer look at.",,,,
This is especially true for terms such as ?쐌onth??or ?쐕nit??which are not self-explanatory.,,,,
"In analyzing the data set, the size of the inner rectangle in combination with the color gives an idea to the analyst of how severe the problem might be.",,,,
"For example, in Figure 3 the ?쐓oftware??column sticks out because of the large size of the inner rectangles (signaling that many customers commented on it) in combination with the dark red colors (,which,means th,""at a relatively large number of customers was dissatisfied with this aspect).,""",,,,
For a customer it will be of special interest to observe the differences in the evaluation of the three printers.,,,,
Strength and weaknesses of the specific printers as seen by other customers become easily visible in the summary report visualization.,,,,
4.2 Cluster Analysis Our second visualization shows groups of customers with a similar opinion.,,,,
"Thus, this kind of visualization is important for companies that would like to learn about different groups of customers.",,,,
"To find the different groups of customer opinions we apply a hierarchical clustering algorithm (Complete Linkage) and then project each cluster representative (on a user-selected hierarchy level) in,2D s,pace usin,""g multi-dimensional scaling as a dimensionality reduction method.,""",,,,
"Each cluster is then visualized using a thumbnail image that depicts for each attribute the percentage of reviews in the cluster that commented on it, split up into negative and positive comments.",,,,
The number of reviews that the cluster contains is mapped (non-linear) to the size of the thumbnails and to the grey tone of the corresponding voronoi cell.,,,,
Figure 4 shows an example in which clusters of customers of printer 1 are shown.,,,,
The largest cluster is the one that summarizes all the reviews that did not criticize any attribute but were satisfied with the printer.,,,,
On the other hand there is also a group of customers that disliked most attributes (cluster 2).,,,,
More interesting however are the clusters that summarize the reviews with a rather differentiated opinion.,,,,
For example cluster 3 aggregates the reviews that had an overall positive tone but in which also some critical aspects (mostly because of the scanner) are mentioned.,,,,
"Finally, clusters 4-6 show user groups with a clearly differentiated opinion about the product.",,,,
Key for the detection of expressive clusters is the use of a meaningful distance function that is able to measure the similarity of reviews.,,,,
In the following we derive a special distance function that satisfies our needs.,,,,
"Given a feature vector r = (i1, i2, ?? in) for each review as described in section 3 we need a distance function that is able to discern the similarity of two reviews with respect to the opinion tha,t is,expressed,""in them.,""",,,,
The similarity between two reviews is increased if they both comment on an attribute and both agree in their opinion about this attribute.,,,,
"Likewise, if an opposite opinion is expressed about an attribute in two reviews, the similarity value between those two reviews has to decrease.",,,,
"This leads us to the first part of our distance function that counts how often the two reviews state opposing opinions on an attribute (see equation 4): So far the positions in the feature vectors i,n whi,ch at lea,""st one of the reviews does not comment on the attribute do not contribute to the distance.,""",,,,
Can they be ignored?,,,,
Consider the following two feature vectors: In this pair of feature vectors only the first attribute is commented on by both reviewers.,,,,
As they both mention the attribute positively the above introduced distance function would consider the two reviews as stating a very similar opinion (distance = 0).,,,,
"However, it is obvious that those reviews do not express a similar opinion on the product.",,,,
"Thus, we also have to take these attributes into account that only one of the reviewers comments on.",,,,
"We do so by calculating for both feature vectors the percentage of positively mentioned attributes, taking only the attributes into account that the other reviewer did not comment on since the ones,that,both comm,""ented on already contribute to the first part of our distance function.,""",,,,
Those two values are then subtracted from each other to measure the difference in their general opinion about the remaining attributes (see equation 5).,,,,
"Finally, both parts of the distance function are weighted with the number of attributes that contribute to it, leading to the following distance function (equation 6): where the factor w allows to b,alanc,e the inf,""luence of the two aspects of the distance function.,""",,,,
4.3 Circular Correlation Map The Circular Correlation Map offers a detailed view on the data.,,,,
"It was introduced in [18] and can be used to find correlations between the different aspects of the data set (such as the attributes, the total score or the assigned cluster id).",,,,
Figure 5-7 shows an application example in which feedback of customers that bought a notebook in an online store was analyzed.,,,,
The feedback was directly collected by a company in order to find out where improvements are necessary.,,,,
"A feature vector is added to the diagram as follows: for each attribute that the customer commented on a line is drawn from the position of the document ID on the right semicircle to the respective,score,value of,""that review in the middle and from the score to the position of the attribute on the left semicircle.,""",,,,
"The color of a line is determined by the opinion that was expressed on the attribute (blue = positive, red = negative).",,,,
If multiple lines are \x0con top of each other the percentage of positive comments is calculated and the lines are colored accordingly.,,,,
The width of a line represents the number of lines that are on top of each other.,,,,
The tool allows to interactively select subsets of the graph to analyze them in detail.,,,,
"Figure 5 gives a visual overview of the relationships between attributes, customer score, and the document ID.",,,,
In Figure 6 only the lines with a user-given score of 1 are displayed.,,,,
The visualization allows us to detect the main problems that led to the low scores.,,,,
"The thick red lines that lead to the attributes ?쐓ervice, time and order??reveal that those aspects troubled the customers.",,,,
"To find out if the service is in general perceived negatively by the customers, we next select the subset of lines that represent the comments on ?쐓ervice??(Figure 7).",,,,
It can be seen that this is not the case as customers that gave a high score on average also commented positively on the service attribute.,,,,
"However, the thickness of the line from ?쐓ervice??to score 1 in relation to the total number of score 1 reviews signals that this was a hot topic among the reviews with score 1.",,,,
Please note that in this visualization it is also possible to go to the lowest level of abstraction and read the text of the review (see Figure 7).,,,,
Figure 5.,,,,
All Customer Comments.,,,,
Most comments have an overall positive tendency (many blue lines).,,,,
Figure 6.,,,,
Analyzing the score 1 comments: Service is one of the attributes that is often mentioned negatively.,,,,

Not all the customers are dissatisfied with the service.,,,,
But this was a hot topic in the score 1 comments.,,,,
5 that they were useful printer attributes.,,,,
For the 40 top-frequency terms only 21 terms were found to be useful by at least one user.,,,,
The detailed comparison of the result of both methods is shown in Figure 8.,,,,
Our method clearly outperforms the standard frequencybased method by a significant margin (at least 44% more relevant attributes).,,,,
"5.2 In-depth evaluation of error sources and improvement potentials As a ground truth for the performance evaluation of our method we used a manually annotated benchmark data set of product reviews,which,is publi,""cly available [16].,""",,,,
The dataset contains customer reviews in which for every sentence the commented product attributes are listed and additionally the polarity of the attribute evaluation is given.,,,,
"For the evaluation only subjective sentences were considered, i.e.",,,,
sentences containing positive or negative statements about the attributes.,,,,
"Furthermore the list of EVALUATION The evaluation of our approach consists of an evaluation of the novel attribute extraction method as well as a detailed discussion of the results with a descriptio,n of,opportuni,""ties for performance enhancements.,""",,,,
5.1 Evaluation of the attribute extraction In order to evaluate the quality of our attribute extraction approach a small user study was conducted.,,,,
For the evaluation scenario the 40 top terms according to frequency were compared to the 40 top terms extracted by our discrimination-based approach (listed in Figure 2).,,,,
"For each of the terms the participants of the user study had to decide whether it is a printer attribute of which they would want to know if users generally liked or disliked it before buying a part,icula,r printer,"", which are precisely the kind of terms that should be extracted.,""",,,,
In order to avoid any bias the terms extracted by both approaches were merged and the terms were ordered alphabetically.,,,,
"Thus, the participants did not know by which method a term was originally extracted.",,,,
As participants of the user study five rather experienced printer owners were recruited.,,,,
An interesting outcome of the user study was that users have quite varying preferences on attribute terms.,,,,
For 31 out of the 40 terms that our method extracted at least one participant thought Figure 8.,,,,
Results of the user-study.,,,,
On the x-axis the number of users is listed that have voted for an extracted term.,,,,
The y-axis indicates how many terms were identified by at least x users as useful attributes.,,,,
A number of 5 users implies that it was an unanimous vote.,,,,
For each individual user vote threshold our method finds at least 44% more useful attributes than the topfrequency method.,,,,
attributes was given.,,,,
The overall accuracy of our method on this benchmark dataset was 0.72.,,,,
In order to discover the error sources we studied these sentences in detail for which the attribute polarity was incorrectly determined.,,,,
"The observed error sources can be subdivided into two main categories: Errors that have their origin in the inadequacy of the opinion word list and errors that are due to the limited possibilities t,o aut,omaticall,""y derive semantics from natural language sources respectively to solve semantic ambiguities.,""",,,,
Table 1 shows a subdivision of the 51 manually examined errors into 7 error sources.,,,,
While natural language ambiguities (errors 5-7) are hard to resolve automatically the adaptation of an opinion word list is a onetime effort that could lead to considerable improvements.,,,,
Therefore we manually edited our general opinion signal word list by deleting problematic words and inserting missing ones (see error 1).,,,,
"In addition, we included opinion words that are opinionbearing in our concrete task and eliminated words from the list that in our case were not useful (see error 2).",,,,
Without any further refinement we were able to increase our performance by 15% and got an overall satisfactory accuracy of 0.83.,,,,
Further improvement would be possible by a separate opinion word list for each attribute (error 3) and opinion word combinations (error 4).,,,,
6 Errors due to the opinion word list: 1.,,,,
"The opinion signal word list that we use turned out to be erroneous which means that on the one hand it contains words that definitely are no opinion signal words and on the other hand certain opini,on si,gnal word,""s are missing.,""",,,,
2,,,,
The general nature of the opinion word list implies that it does not contain context-dependent opinion signal words.,,,,
For digital cameras important opinion signal words could be for example ?쐓harp?? ?쐋ight?? ?쐀lurry??or ?쐑uick??which are not included in the general list.,,,,
At the same time words such as ?쐁apture??or ?쐓hot??might evoke negative emotions in general but cannot be considered as negative in the context of a digital camera.,,,,
3,,,,
Some of the opinion signal words have no generally valid polarity but depend on the nature of the attribute they describe.,,,,
For example a ?쐓hort??response time may be favorable for a camera but a ?쐓hort??battery life is not.,,,,
4,,,,
"Finally, composed opinion signal words such as ?쐋ast long?? ?쐃asy to manipulate?? and ?쐃xceeded my expectations??are lacking in the list.",,,,
Errors due to the ambiguity of natural language respectively the difficulties of automatic detection of semantics: 5.,,,,
"Composed expressions and fixed phrases cannot be detected by just searching for single signal words (e.g. ?쐔his camera will not let you down?? ?쏧 got this camera about a month ago and I can?셳 put,it d,own?? ?쐄,""eatures?쫆re unmatched for any camera in this price range?? ??mb for a camera like this is a joke??.,""",,,,
"The same applies for poetic descriptions, metaphors or ironic statements.",,,,
6,,,,
"Our mapping strategy may fail if a turn of opinion is introduced by conjunctions such as ?쐀ut, however ?╈?like in the following sentence: ?쏷he battery life seems to be on the short side but adeq,uate,for most,""situations.??7.,""",,,,
There are cases when an attribute is not explicitly but only indirectly mentioned.,,,,
For example in the sentence ?쏷he camera is too small??the attribute ?쐓ize??is implicit.,,,,
"RELATED WORK Within the context of opinion analysis three main tasks can be distinguished: Subjectivity Analysis (detecting whether a text is subjective or objective), Sentiment Analysis (detecting,wheth,er the ge,""neral opinion in a text is positive, neutral or negative), and Opinion Mining (additionally analyzing what has been commented on positively or negatively).,""",,,,
As our approach is clearly situated within the context of opinion mining we are going to review primarily these latter approaches in this related work section.,,,,
A more comprehensive overview on opinion analysis techniques can be found in [9].,,,,
"Furthermore, we compare our approach to existing techniques for the visualization of extracted opinions.",,,,
"6.1 Attribute-based opinion mining Attribute-based opinion mining is often made by two successive steps: First, the attributes (sometimes also called features), that have been commented on, are iden,tifie,""d.,"",",,,,
"Secondly, the respective opinion that has been expressed on them is detected.",,,,
Different approaches to extract the attributes exist.,,,,
"In [5, 17] the Apriori algorithm is used to find frequent features (that means sets of terms that occur frequently together in a sentence).",,,,
"Subsequently, two pruning steps are applied to refine the result.",,,,
"In contrast to this approach, Popescu et al. [10] consider all noun phrases as attributes whose frequency is above a certain threshold.",,,,
The list of attributes is then further filtered by calculating the PMI score (Point-wise mutual information) between each phrase and discriminator phrases (such as],,,,
[is a scanner],,,,
[ or],,,,
[scanner has],,,,
[ etc.,,,,
in case of reviews on scanners).,,,,
The PMI scores are calculated on a set of web documents containing the product name.,,,,
The paper reports a 22% increase in precision with 3% loss of recall compared to the results reported in [5].,,,,
[15] proposes and compares two different approaches.,,,,
One of them is based on a mixture language model and the other one applies the likelihoodratio test.,,,,
They report better results when using the likelihoodratio test.,,,,
"Titov and McDonald introduce in [19] the concept of a Multi-Aspect Sentiment model that is based on an adaption of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to extract rated attributes (here called aspects) from,revie,""ws.,"",",,,,
"Finally, the approach of Kim and Hovy [6] is based on FrameNet, an online lexical database which consists of 800 semantic frames.",,,,
The idea is to label each sentence that contains an opinion-bearing term with semantic roles and defer the attribute and opinion holder in the sentence from these.,,,,
Our approach is different from all the above in that we determine the attribute by our novel discrimination-based method.,,,,
"Our mapping of opinion words to the attributes is similar to [5, 17].",,,,
"However, we use a different weighting function and a cut-off value, which both improves the performance.",,,,
We also aggregate the sentence level opinion into an overall opinion value on the review level.,,,,
6.2 Visual Opinion Analysis Visualization of opinions has not yet been a major focus of research in the area.,,,,
"In [7], for example, the authors suggest to use traditional bar charts to visualize how many positive respectively negative statements exist within the document corpus.",,,,
The advantage of our technique is that it is much more scalable with respect to the number of attributes and the number of products that can be displayed.,,,,
"Furthermore, our matrix-based visualization simplifies the comparison between both different attributes and different products.",,,,
Among the other visualizations of opinion mining results is Pulse [2] which clusters reviews according to topic and then calculates the average opinion per cluster.,,,,
The result is displayed in a treemap with color being mapped to the average opinion.,,,,
The BLEWS system introduced in [3] analyzes blogs with respect to their political orientation.,,,,
The average emotional sentiment of a set of articles is visualized as a glow around the bars that represent the number of documents that link to a specific news article.,,,,
Morinaga et al. [8] display characteristic phrases for the group of positive or negative sentences in a 2D scatterplot.,,,,
In [14] the development over time of RSS feeds that report on the U.S. elections is visualized.,,,,
"Finally, [4] has to be mentioned as the only technique that does not only display positive or negative sentiment but also other aspects such as pleasure, pain, power conflict etc.",,,,
The detected emotions are visualized in an adapted rose plot.,,,,
To the best of our knowledge currently no technique exists that analyzes and visualizes customer feedback with respect to clusters of reviews in which similar opinions are expressed.,,,,
"In addition, we provide correlation maps to visualize the detailed distribution and correlations of attributes, opinions, and scores.",,,,
"7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Providing better access to the large amount of textual customer feedback data has a high impact both for the companies that need to know what the customers like or disl,ike a,bout thei,""r products and for the customers who want to find the product that fits best to their needs.,""",,,,
In this paper we address the whole opinion analysis pipeline and introduce novel techniques for the automatic feature extraction as well as for the visual analysis of the detected opinions.,,,,
"First, we extract the important information out of the unstructured natural language reviews and make it accessible in a structured format.",,,,
"Our main contributions here are a new discrimination-based attribute extraction method and a novel opinion feature construction that generates one feature vector per review breaking the overall opin,ion d,own into,""opinions about individual product attributes.,""",,,,
"Secondly, we develop innovative visual analytics methods in order to make the large amount of review opinions easily and quickly accessible to the analyst.",,,,
"Interesting opinion profiles are revealed by review summary and clustering visualizations, to allow an interactive exploration and to discover hidden patterns and relations.",,,,
"Our contributions are the new visual summary reports, a novel distance function for clustering review feature vectors, the cluster thumbnails and the circular correlation maps.",,,,
The presented visualization techniques have been developed in cooperation with a product manufacturer and are thus optimized for their specific needs.,,,,
We believe that those visualizations also provide valuable insight for customers.,,,,
"However, a visualization that is specialized on potential buyers might additionally highlight the (negative) outliers in the set of product reviews as they are often considered to be the most inform,ative,ones for,""deciding if a product fits ones needs.,""",,,,
"In the future, we would like to provide more detailed information by analyzing the context of the attributes (cooccurrence analysis).",,,,
"In addition, improving the automatic opinion extraction by applying more sophisticated linguistic methods for negation handling, anaphora resolution and the development of techniques to detect irony,are,challengi,""ng problems that need more research.,""",,,,

"While this set of emotions is culturally the most robust, it is worth noting the imbalance between positive and negative emotions.",,,,
"There are five negative emotions, one neutral, one positive, and surprise, which is ambiguous.",,,,
"Secondary emotions are also noted in the API, and these were used to further classify surprise.",,,,
"Through our analysis of the video, surprise seemed to be most often grouped with happiness, so we decided to list it as a positive emotion.",,,,
The disparity between negative and positive emotions is not a fluke.,,,,
"Research by Robert Schrauf, a linguistics professor at Penn State, was conducted on the words we choose to describe our emotions, and concluded that most of these words tend to be negative, while on,ly 30,% are pos,""itive.,""",,,,
"His theory is that negative emotions require more thought to rationalize, and consequently generate more words.",,,,
"For instance, fear can often be a response to a perceived danger, something that requires our attention; whereas happiness is a signal that all is well and our brain doesn?셳 need to process it any,longe,""r.,"",",,,,

We limited our selection to these ten inaugural speeches because they include the last five presidents most relevant to our public consciousness.,,,,
"We calculated the percentage score and corresponding arc for each speech by averaging primary emotion strength for all time stamps, with positive (happiness and surprise) emotions ranging from 0 to,100 a,nd negati,""ve emotions (anger, sadness, fear, disgust, contempt) ranging from 0 to -100.,""",,,,

"1 Introduction With increased use of social media (FacebookTM , TwitterTM , and non-English equivalents such as WeiboTM ), the age of big data is upon us.",,,,
"Some problems concerning big data are characterized solely by size, e.g., draw a FacebookTM friendship graph.",,,,
"Other data is better modeled as a stream of small packets or messages, e.g., FacebookTM posts, cell phone messages, or TwitterTM tweets.",,,,
Here the problem of size relates to the rate at which these events occur.,,,,
"Taking TwitterTM as an example, one estimate gave, on average, three thousand tweets per second in February 2012, a six-fold increase over the same month two years earlier.",,,,
"Creating models, algorithms and tools to make sense of massive volumes of streaming data is an active area of research.",,,,
One approach is to provide a methodology for a real-time visualization and summation of the data that will provide an overview of the data and how it is changing.,,,,
"For this, we must take several factors into account.",,,,
"First, and most obvious, the velocity of the data means that it arrives in an almost continuous fashion.",,,,
"We need to handle this data stream efficiently, merging each packet with existing data and updating the visualization in a way that preserves the user's mental map.",,,,
"Second, messages that are close in time often exhibit similar characteristics.",,,,
"For example, a discussion may arise in TwitterTM generating considerable cross-copying, or rewriting, of similar content.",,,,
"Our understanding can be greatly improved if related packets are appropriately grouped, categorized and summarized.",,,,
"Finally, while a visual and semantic summary can provide an overview of the data stream, the user may also need tools to explore details once a topic of interest is identified.",,,,
"In this paper, we propose a technique for visualizing and analyzing streaming packets viewed as a dynamic graph, and its instantiation in the form of TwitterScope, a system for visualizing TwitterTM,mess,""ages.,"",",,,,
"Our approach has the following features and novel algorithmic components: ??A succinct visual classification and textual summary, with details on demand.",,,,
"Our system automatically groups tweets into topic areas, thus helping the user to discover emerging and important events.",,,,
"Individual tweets can be revealed by rollovers, and the original source and link can be obtained by a mouse click.",,,,
??Real-time monitoring and dynamic visualization.,,,,
"We continuously monitor the TwitterTM message stream, pushing new items to the visual foreground.",,,,
"In doing so, our approach uses a dynamic graph layout algorithm and Procrustes projection to ensure that the layout is stable.",,,,
??A new stable graph packing algorithm for disconnected components.,,,,
"When unrelated clusters of tweets form separate components, we apply the packing algorithm to ensure that the visualization is stable even on a component level.",,,,
??Our system also allows the user to shift the display to an earlier point in time to explore what was discussed in the past.,,,,
We describe our approach as instantiated in a system called TwitterScope.,,,,
"TwitterScope runs in HTML5, and is thus accessible to a broad audience.",,,,
"It can run either \x0cin passive mode for monitoring topics of interest, or as an active tool for exploring TwitterTM discussions.",,,,

TwitterScope can be run at http://bit.ly/HA6KIR.,,,,
"Our system allows users to follow the data stream development in real-time, observing emerging areas of interests and events.",,,,

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.,,,,
"In the next section, we review related work on visualizing dynamic text data.",,,,
"This is followed, in Sections 3 and 4, by a detailed discussion of the core of our approach: the algorithms for semantic analysis, clustering and mapping, dynamic layout, and a novel algorithm for s,table,packing,""of disconnected components.,""",,,,

We conclude with a brief discussion including directions for future work in Section 6.,,,,
"2 Related Work Visualizing streams of text is an active area of research, especially with the growth of social media and related interest in gaining insight about this data.",,,,
S?ilic? [34] gives a recent survey.,,,,
"Much of this work has a different focus from ours, dealing with the statistical analysis and presentation of topics or terms, focusing on the emergence of topic events [10], and often relying on off,#NAME?,processi,""ng [29].,""",,,,
"Our approach focuses on the visualization of the text messages themselves, arriving in real-time.",,,,
Topic information emerges from the display of the messages.,,,,
"For example, the TextPool visualization proposed by Albrech-Buehler et al. [1] \x0cscans summaries of new articles, gathers important terms, determines connectedness between terms based on co-occurr,ence,and other,""measures, and draws the resulting graph.,""",,,,
The graph evolves over time as terms and edges appear and disappear; graph stability is achieved by using appropriate constraints with force-directed placement.,,,,
There is always just one component.,,,,
"A context-preserving dynamic text visualization proposed by Cui et al. [11] displays word clouds to glean information from a collection of documents over time, keeping their layout stable using a sp,ring,embedding,""algorithm, aided by a mesh constructed over existing nodes.,""",,,,
TopicNets [24] analyzes large text corpora off-line.,,,,
"The main view is of a documenttopic graph, though the system also allows aggregate nodes.",,,,
"Topic similarity is determined using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), with topics then positioned using multidimensional scaling.",,,,
"After topics are fixed, documents are positioned using forcedirected placement.",,,,
"The time dimension is handled by a separate visualization, with documents placed chronologically around a (broken) circle, and connected to related topic nodes placed inside the circle.",,,,
Alsakran et al. offer another approach in STREAMIT [2].,,,,
"This system displays messages or documents positioned using a spring-based force-directed placement, where the ideal spring length is based on similarity of keyword vectors of documents.",,,,
Scalability is achieved by parallelization on a GPU.,,,,
"Clustering is based on geometry, a second-order attribute, rather than directly on content.",,,,
Clusters are labeled with the title of the most recent document joining the cluster.,,,,
Our work differs from the above in that we use a map metaphor to visualize clusters.,,,,
We do not assume that the underlying content graph is connected.,,,,
Our proposal supports monitoring text streams in real time.,,,,
"In our approach, for semantic analysis, we considered the options of either LDA, or term frequency-inverse document frequency, to derive message-to-message similarity.",,,,
We find clusters directly from this measurement of similarity.,,,,
"Our visualization is focused on discrete messages as they arrive, and rather than presenting items in lists or node-link diagrams, we display messages within a geographic map metaphor, where topics,are d,epicted a,""s countries.,""",,,,
This provides an aid to comprehension [15].,,,,
"Edges are also rendered to give a sense of connectivity, as the density of connections may vary considerably between and within topic countries.",,,,
These objectives create new problems in maintaining visual stability over time.,,,,
"Beyond the stasis provided by basic graph layout, we apply a Procrustes transformation to documents within a component, and propose a stable packing algorithm for components to achieve further stabi,lity.,"","",",,,,
"Focusing on the underlying layout algorithms, we note the large body of prior research on dynamic graph layout, in which the goal is to maintain a stable layout of a graph as it is modified via oper,ation,""s, typica"",""lly insertion or deletion of nodes and edges.,""",,,,
"This strategy is justified by various studies, e.g., [3], which show that some procedure for maintaining the viewer's mental map can be a significant asset for certain visualization-based tasks.",,,,
"Brandes and Wagner adapt a force-directed model to dynamic graphs using a Bayesian framework [8], while Herman et al. [25] rely on good static layouts.",,,,
Diehl and Go?rg [12] consider graphs in a sequence to create smoother transitions.,,,,
"Brandes and Corman [6] present a system for visualizing network evolution in which each modification is shown in a separate layer of a 3D representation, \x0cwith nodes common to two layers represen,ted a,s columns,""connecting the layers.,""",,,,
"Thus, mental map preservation is achieved by pre-computing good locations for the nodes and fixing t hose p ositions a cross t he l ayers.",,,,
"M ost r ecently, B randes a nd M ader [7] studied offline dynamic graph drawings and compared various techniques such as aggregation (forming a large graph of all nodes of all time steps), anchoring,(tyi,ng nodes,""to the previous positions) and linking (linking nodes from successive time steps, [14]), and found linking to be a generally preferred approach, followed by anchoring.,""",,,,
"While the issue of mental map preservation adopted in such approaches remains an important research issue, we note that in our application we want to avoid distortion of the layout for the purpose o,f vis,ual stabi,""lity.,""",,,,
This is because such distortions introduce biases that can persist over time (cf.,,,,
"[31, 4]).",,,,
In addition we want a fast procedure suitable for online dynamic layout.,,,,
"Hence we do not use techniques such as anchoring or linking, or ones that rely on offline processing of a given sequence of graphs.",,,,
"Although there does not appear to have been much previous work on stably packing complex objects (Section 4), there has been much work on the related problem of stably removing node overlap (e.g. [1,""3, 18"","", 22]).,"",",,,,
"This has been limited to removing overlaps of simple shapes, and not aimed at packing them.",,,,
"On the other hand, there has also been work on optimal unrestricted placement of complex shapes.",,,,
Landesberger et al. [35] studied ways of clustering disconnected components for visual analysis.,,,,
Freivalds et al. [17] proposed a polyomino-based algorithm for packing disconnected components.,,,,
"Goehlsdorf et al. [23] introduced new quality measures to evaluate two-dimensional configurations, which yield more compact layouts.",,,,
"3 Dynamic Visualization Our aim is to provide a visual search engine, presenting a collection of messages matching a search expression.",,,,
"Given a collection of messages, we would like to make an overview that helps people to make sense of it.",,,,
"Specifically, we like to assist the user in answering these questions: ??Q1: How many messages are there?",,,,
??Q2: How are they related?,,,,
"??Q3: What are the groups or clusters, which messages and authors belong to each?",,,,
??Q4: What topics are discussed?,,,,
??Q5: How does interest in topics change over time?,,,,
??Q6: Can I drill down to the individual messages after I have identified interesting clusters?,,,,
??Q7: Can I move the display back in time to explore how a topic emerged?,,,,
"These questions are answered in this and the next section with the help of of semantic analysis, clustering and keyword summarization of the clusters (Q2, Q3, Q4).",,,,
"Clusters \x0care visualized with a map metaphor (Q3), and dynamic graph layout and packing algorithms are used to ensure visual stability (Q5).",,,,
"The other questions are addressed in Section 5, where we present a prototype system ??TwitterScope, that has a time series chart showing the number of tweets (Q1), and allows the user to inspect eme,rging,topics b,""y mouseovers on the chart (Q5), and to drill down and recall historical data (Q6, Q7) by clicking on the chart.,""",,,,
3.1 Semantic Analysis The first step is to cluster the messages into sub-topics using semantic analysis.,,,,
One of the most effective methods for the semantic analysis of textual data is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [5].,,,,
"This is a generative model, which assumes that documents are distributions over topics, and topics are distributions over words.",,,,
It finds these distributions by a generative process that fits the observation of documents over words.,,,,
"Once the probability distribution is found through LDA, so that the probability of document i in topic k is pi,k , the dissimilarity of two documents i and j can be calculated using the Kullback-Lei,bler,(KL) dive,""rgence, Since the Kullback-Leibler divergence is not symmetric, in practice we use the symmetrized version, DsKL (i, j) = 12 (DKL (i, j) + DKL ( j, i)), and define similarity as 1/(1 + DsKL (i, j)).,""",,,,
A simpler and computationally cheaper alternative is to calculate similarity using word counts.,,,,
"Since a naive use of word counts can be biased toward commonly used words, we use a scaled version based on term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf).",,,,
"Let D be the set of documents, d ??D a document consisting of a sequence of words (terms), and t a particular term of interest in d. Then the scaled word count based on tf-idf is tf-idf(t, d) = tf(t,"", d)"",""쨌 idf(t,"",""D), where tf(t, d) is the fraction of times the term t appears in d, and idf(t, D) is the logarithm of the inverse of the proportion of documents containing the term t, Similarity of documents can be calculated by cosine similarity of the tf-idf vectors.,""",,,,
"Before computing similarity using either LDA or tf-idf, we first clean the messages, removing markup symbols and stop words, leaving only plain content-carrying words.",,,,
"For example, in TwitterTM messages, we remove terms often seen in tweets that are not important in computing similarity, such as ?쏳T??(retweet).",,,,
"Another common term appearing in many tweets are ?쐌entions,??such as ??joe.??Sometimes these tags appear multiple times in one tweet.",,,,
"We filter out these terms since they may contain unique words which would rank highly with tf-idf, but actually are not very important to matching the content.",,,,
"In addition, we filter out URLs which, in tweets, are almost always in a shortened alias form, and are not necessarily a bijection.",,,,
"Finally, we remove common stop words (e.g., ?쐔he??and ?쏿re?? before computing LDA or tf-idf similarity.",,,,
"Comparing LDA and tf-idf, the former is more sophisticated, and seems potentially more accurate.",,,,
"But in our application, we found LDA was not any better than td-idf in identifying meaningful clusters.",,,,
"Sometimes LDA clusters messages that have no common words, because LDA treats them as belonging to the same topic.",,,,
"The problem is that with short messages such as tweets, these assignments are not always meaningful.",,,,
"With tf-idf, messages in the same cluster must at least share some words, making the cluster easier to interpret, even if it is not always semantically ?쐁orrect.??For example, we observed that tf-i,df as,signed hi,""gh similarity to the tweets, ?쏣verything I know comes through visualization.,""",,,,
"Third eye senses??and ?쏮any eyes: create visualization,??among a data set of many tweets containing the word ?쐖isualization,??because only those two tweets also contained the word ?쐃ye.??Overall,,like,other re,""searchers, we found that semantic analysis of very short text packets, such as tweets, is a challenging task [28], and will likely be studied for years to come.,""",,,,
"After the similarity between messages is calculated, we apply a threshold (default 0.2) to the similarity matrix to ignore links between messages with low similarity.",,,,
"While this is not essential to the remaining steps described in this section, we found that applying this threshold can turn completely unrelated clusters into disconnected components in the graph o,f mes,""sages.,"",",,,,
"This helps in making each of the clusters more rounded, and the map representation more aesthetic, but also introduces the complication of packing components in a stable manner, on top of the need f,or st,ability w,""ithin components.,""",,,,
We will discuss these issues in the rest of this section and the next one.,,,,
"3.2 Clustering and Mapping After message similarities are calculated, we treat the collection of messages as a graph ??each message is a node, and every pair of messages is connected by an edge whos,e wei,ght is th,""e similarity between the two messages.,""",,,,
A weight of zero corresponds to no edge being present.,,,,
"We draw the graph by multidimensional scaling (MDS), so that similar messages are placed close to each other.",,,,
"For visualization, each node has an associated glyph or icon, such as thumbnail pictures for tweets.",,,,
"We then apply the PRISM algorithm [18], which removes node overlaps while maintaining their relative proximity in the input layout.",,,,
We limit the number of messages displayed depending on the available display area.,,,,
Typically in a browser we show up to 500 tweets.,,,,
"Because we filter o ut similarities below a threshold, the graph may be very sparse or disconnected.",,,,
We therefore also filter out singleton components.,,,,
"We apply modularity clustering [30] to identify clusters of messages, using edge weights proportional to message similarities.",,,,
"After finding clusters, one possibility is to highlight them by assigning colors.",,,,
"We go one step further, and use a map metaphor [15] to depict clusters: messages are treated as towns and cities, where similar messages are close.",,,,
"Clusters of highly related messages then form countries, each enclosed by a boundary, and each country is assigned a color as different as possible from its neighbors within a defined palette [26].,"","",,",,,,
"As an example, in Fig.",,,,
"1, a screen shot of TwitterScope taken on Sunday March 18, 2012, we see part of a map for the keyword ?쐍ews.??Each ?쐁ity??represents a tweet, and is shown as a thumbnail picture of the person who,poste,d the twe,""et.,""",,,,
"There is a small \x0ccountry on the right of the figure relating to news events about Syria, with one tweet highlighted.",,,,
There is also a country to the west with a Japanese keyword summary.,,,,
"To the south of the Japanese topic is one with the keyword ?쏷rayvon,??relating to the tragedy of February 26 in which a 17-year-old unarmed African-American was shot by neighborhood watcher George,Zimme,""rman.,"",",,,,
"Three weeks later, the alleged shooter remained free, and this caused much discussion, and would soon make national news, as discussed further in Section 5.",,,,
A small gray country in the southeast of the map with summary ?쏰ccupy month??contain tweets about the 6-month anniversary of the ?쏰ccupy Wall Street??movement on that day.,,,,
"There are also two countries connected by edges in the center with summary words ?쏮uamba.??They are related to the incident in which the English football player Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac ar,rest,during a,""FA Cup quarter-final in London.,""",,,,
"This event took place on the previous evening, so there were many tweets about it.",,,,
(Messages on these topics continued to form large clusters for several more days.),,,,
"Thus, at a glance, we immediately see the themes of discussions in TwitterTM space about ?쐍ews.??Using a map metaphor makes the visualization seem more appealing than a plain graph layout, and clus,ters,are easie,""r to identify (Fig.,""",,,,
2).,,,,
"Figure 2: A map metaphor visualization (left) seems more appealing than a plain graph layout (right), and clusters seem easier to identify.",,,,
3.3 Dynamic Layout The above steps describe a static layout method.,,,,
"Our goal, however, is to handle a dynamic graph of text message streams, with the visualization updated frequently, say, every minute.",,,,
"To put this in context, consider the rate of messages in a TwitterTM stream.",,,,
The rate clearly will depend on the initial filtering.,,,,
"We found that, for example, there were on average around 400 new tweets containing the keyword ?쐍ews??per \x0cminute, sometimes spiking to 1200 tweets.",,,,
"On the other hand, for the keyword ?쐔ech,??there were about 40 tweets per minute, and for ?쐖isualization,??only about one new tweet per minute.",,,,
"Since we limit the number of messages shown, active streams, such as ?쐍ews??in TwitterTM , require the complete replacement of every tweet by new ones at each update, and often the clusters are abo,ut co,mpletely,""different topics.,""",,,,
"In these situations, it may not be as important (or possible) to maintain a stable mental map.",,,,
"In smaller streams, for example, ?쐖isualization,??only a portion of the messages will be replaced, so it is important for the remaining messages to appear at approximately the same positions to pre,serve,a user's,""mental map.,""",,,,
The problem of laying out dynamic graphs to preserve a user's mental map has been studied previously.,,,,
"One approach is to ?쏿nchor??some, or all, of the nodes, or to limit node movement by adding artificial edges linking graphs across successive time frames [14].",,,,
"However, such approaches can introduce biases in the visual representation of the underlying data, which can persist over time.",,,,
"In our approach, we preserve the mental map via a two-step approach.",,,,
"Before laying out a new graph, we initialize each node in the new graph with its previous position, if it had one, otherwise at the average of its neighbors in the previous graph, and then apply MDS,by l,ocal opti,""mization.,""",,,,
"We found that MDS tends to be quite stable in terms of maintaining relative node positions, though the graph may rotate, or expand or shrink.",,,,
We therefore apply a Procrustes transformation [33] to the node coordinates after MDS layout.,,,,
"Procrustes transformation is a well-known technique [9], which attempts to find the best alignment of two inputs via rotation, translation, and scaling.",,,,
"In our application, we found that when the common set of nodes are close in the first layout, but are further apart in the second one (due to the insertion of other nodes between them), a Procrustes,tran,sformatio,""n tends to scale down the new layout.,""",,,,
"In the context of abstract graph layout where nodes are represented as points, this is not a problem.",,,,
"However, in our setting, nodes are represented by figures h aving a fixed width and height, so shrinking the layout can cause node overlaps.",,,,
"For that reason, we limit the transformation to rotations and translations, and use a scale factor of 1.",,,,
"4 An Algorithm for Stable Packing of Disconnected Components The dynamic layout algorithm described in the previous section ensures that the positions of nodes are stable in successive time frames a,s lon,g as the,""graph is connected.,""",,,,
"On the other hand, when there are multiple disconnected components the situation is more complex.",,,,
"While the dynamic layout algorithm aligns drawings of the same component in consecutive time frames, this alignment does not consider potential overlaps between components.",,,,
"Such overlaps can occur, for example, due to addition of new nodes to one component.",,,,
"These new nodes may expand the boundary of the component, causing overlaps with other components.",,,,
"A standard technique for arranging disconnected components is to pack them to minimize total area and avoid wasted space, while avoiding overlaps.",,,,
"This problem has been studied in graph drawing [17, 23], in VLSI design, and in space planning for \x0cbuilding and manufacturing, where it is known as the floor-planning problem.In these cases the,empha,sis is on,""maximal utilization of space.,""",,,,
A widely used algorithm for packing disconnected graph components is that of Freivalds et al. [17].,,,,
It represents each disconnected component as a collection of polyominoes (tiles made of squares joined at edges).,,,,
"The polyominoes are generated to cover node bounding boxes, as well as graph edges.",,,,
"The algorithm places components one at a time, from large to small.",,,,
"It attempts to place the center of polyominoes at consecutive discrete grid locations in increasing distance from the origin, until it finds one that does not overlap any components already placed.,"","",,",,,,
"The algorithm yields packings that tend to utilize space efficiently, even though the computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of components and average number of polyominoes pe,r com,""ponent.,"",",,,,

(a) Graph with overlapping components.,,,,
(b) Standard packing algorithms ignore relative positions.,,,,
(c) Result of proposed stable packing algorithm.,,,,
"In the context of dynamic graph visualization, no packing algorithm that we are aware of was designed with maintaining layout stability in mind.",,,,
"For example, Fig.",,,,
"3 (a) shows six disconnected components, some of them overlapping each other.",,,,
"If we process this graph with a common packing algorithm (in this case, gvpack in Graphviz [21]), we obtain Fig.",,,,
3 (b).,,,,
The proximity relations are completely lost.,,,,
"For example, the orange component, which was below the large green component, is now at its upper right.",,,,
In this section we describe a packing algorithm that aims at maintaining layout stability.,,,,
"The algorithm extends the label overlap removal method of Gansner and Hu [18], to work on graph components of arbitrary shape, not only rectangular node labels.",,,,
"In addition, the new algorithm attempts to remove ?쐕nderlap????unnecessary space between components; thus it is a packing algorithm, not only an overlap removal method.",,,,
Figure 4: Illustration of our stable packing algorithm.,,,,
(a) Polyominoes are generated to cover nodes and edges of the components in Fig.,,,,
3,,,,
A triangulation is carried out over the centers of the components.,,,,
"(b), (c) and (d) After 3 iterations, the overlap has been eliminated while the relative position of components remains stable.",,,,
The resulting graph is shown in Fig.,,,,
3(c) 4.1 Stable Packing of Disconnected Components We begin by adapting the polyomino algorithm to component packing.,,,,
"For each component, polyominoes are computed to cover the nodes and their labels, as well as all the edges.",,,,
Fig.,,,,
4 (a) shows the overlapped components of Fig.,,,,
"3 (a), now covered by polyominoes.",,,,
We use the polyominoes to detect collisions between components.,,,,
We set up an underlying mesh (not shown).,,,,
The mesh cell size may or may not be the same as the polyomino size.,,,,
"When polyominoes move due to adjustment to the position of the corresponding components, we hash the mesh cells that intersect with the polyominoes of one component, and detect a collision of this c,ompon,ent with,""another component by checking the array hash table against polyominoes of the second component.,""",,,,
"To achieve our goal of removing overlaps and underlaps, while preserving the proximity relations of the initial component configuration, we first set up a rigid ?쐓caffolding??structure so that whil,e com,ponents c,""an move around, their relative positions are maintained as much as possible.,""",,,,
"This scaffolding is constructed using an approximate proximity graph that is rigid, in the form of a Delaunay triangulation (DT).",,,,
The triangulation is carried out using the center of each component.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
"4 (a) shows the triangulations as thick dark lines, connecting the centers of components.",,,,
"Once we find a DT, we search every edge in it and test for component overlaps or underlaps along that edge.",,,,
"If there is an overlap, we compute how far the components should move apart along the direction of the edge to remove the overlap.",,,,
"If there is an underlap, we compute how far the components should move toward each other along the edge to close the gap.",,,,
"The distance of the move can be calculated using an iterative algorithm, where two overlapping components are first separated enough so that they do not overlap, then a simple bisection algorithm is,appl,ied until,""a sufficiently accurate measure of the distance of travel is achieved.,""",,,,
"In an implementation, though, we can use a cheaper though less accurate measure.",,,,
"Suppose for one of these edges, the two endpoint components are i and j.",,,,
"Let the edge be {i, j}, and the coordinates of the two end points be xi0 and x0j .",,,,
"We project the corners of each polyomino onto \x0cJGAA, 0(0) 0?? (0) 11 the line xi0 ??x0j .",,,,
"If the two components overlap, it is certain that the projection of the components will overlap.",,,,
The amount of overlap on line xi0 ??x0j is denoted by 灌i j > 0.,,,,
"On the other hand, if the two components are separated, it is likely (but not always true) that the projection of the components are separated by a gap.",,,,
We denote this underlap (negative overlap) as 灌i j < 0.,,,,
"If 灌i j > 0 but no collision is detected, we set 灌i j = 0.",,,,
We 灌 ij define the ideal length factor to be ti j = 1 + kx0 ?뭯 0k .,,,,
i j Figure 5: Illustration of ideal length factors.,,,,
(a) Components i and j overlap.,,,,
Projection of polyominoes of i on the line i ??j extends as far right as B; projection of polyominoes of j on the line i ??j extends as far left as A.,,,,
"Since |AB| is 1/3 of |i j|, the ideal length factor is 1 + 1/3 = 1.33.",,,,
(b) Components i and j underlap.,,,,
"Since |AB| is 1/4 of |i j|, the ideal length factor is 1 ??1/4 = 0.75.",,,,
Component overlap and underlap can be removed if we expand or shrink the edge between these components; see Fig.,,,,
5,,,,
"Therefore we want to generate a layout such that an edge in the proximity graph has the ideal edge length close to tij kxi0 ??x0j k. In other words, we want to minimize the following stress function,Here,dij = si,""j kxi0 ??x0j k is the ideal distance for the edge {i, j}, sij is a scaling factor related to the overlap factor tij (see below), wij = 1/kdij k2 is a weighting factor, and EP is the set of edges of the proximity graph.,""",,,,
"Given that the DT is a planar graph with at most 3k ?? edges, where k is the number of components, the stress function (1) has no more than 3k ??6 terms.",,,,
"Furthermore, the rigidity of the triangulated graph provides a good scaffolding that constrains the relative position of the components and helps to preserve the global structure of the original lay,out.,"","",",,,,
Trying to removing overlaps and underlaps too quickly with the above model with sij = tij can be counter-productive.,,,,
Imagine the situation where components form a regular mesh configuration.,,,,
"Initially, the components do not overlap.",,,,
"Then assume that component i in the center grows quickly, so that it overlaps severely with its nearby components, while the other components remain unchanged.",,,,
"Suppose components i and j form an edge in the proximity graph, and they overlap.",,,,
"If we try to make the \x0clength of the edge equal to tij kxi0 ??x0j k, we will find t hat t ij i s m uch l arger t han 1, and an optimal solution to the stress model keeps all the other vertices at,or c,lose to t,""heir current positions, but moves the large component i outside the mesh entirely, to a position that avoids any overlap.,""",,,,
This is not desirable because it destroys the relative position information.,,,,
"Therefore we damp the overlap and underlap factor by setting sij = max(smin , min(tij , smax )) and try to remove overlaps and underlaps gradually.",,,,
"Here smax > 1 is a parameter limiting the amount of overlap, and smin a parameter limiting the amount of underlap that we are allowed to remove in one iteration.",,,,
"In experiments, we found that smax = 1.5 and smin = 0.8 work well.",,,,
"After minimizing (1), we arrive at a layout that may still have component overlaps and underlaps.",,,,
"We then regenerate the proximity graph using DT, calculate the ideal length factor along the edges of this graph, and rerun the minimization.",,,,
This defines an iterative process that terminates when there are no more overlaps or underlaps along the edges of the proximity graph.,,,,
"In addition, to avoid having components oscillate between overlap and underlap, we set smin = 1 after a fixed n umber N o f iterations.",,,,
"Based on experience, we use N = 30.",,,,
"For many disconnected graphs, the above algorithm yields a drawing that is free of component overlaps, and utilizes the space well.",,,,
"For some graphs, however, especially those with components having extreme aspect ratios, overlaps may still occur, even though no overlaps are detected along the edges of the proximity graph.",,,,
"To overcome this situation, once the above process has converged so that no more overlaps are detected over the proximity graph edges, we hash the components one at a time in the background mesh to,detec,t any ove,""rlaps, and augment the proximity graph with additional edges, where each edge consists of a pair of components that overlap.,""",,,,
We then re-solve (1).,,,,
This process is repeated until no more component overlaps are found.,,,,
We call this the proximity graph-based STAble PACKing (STAPACK) algorithm.,,,,
Algorithm 1 gives a detailed description of this algorithm.,,,,
"While we do not have a proof that this procedure converges, in practice it always does so, often very quickly.",,,,
"We impose a limit of 1000 iterations, although the algorithm has not been observed to ever take this many iterations.",,,,
Fig.,,,,
4 (b-d) shows the result of 3 iterations on the overlapping components in Fig.,,,,
4 (a).,,,,
"As can be seen, in this case the process converges quickly and the result in Fig.",,,,
"4 (d) packs the components with no overlaps, while proximity is well-preserved.",,,,
4.2 Computational Complexity We now discuss the computational complexity of the proposed stable packing algorithm STAPACK.,,,,
"Let there be a total of P polyomino cells for all graphs, and k disconnected components.",,,,
Let the underlying mesh have dimension m 횞 m. Setting up the mesh takes time and memory proportional to m2 .,,,,
The Delaunay triangulation can be computed in O(k log k) time [16].,,,,
We used the mesh generator Triangle [32] for this purpose.,,,,
"Detecting a collision of two polyominoes takes time proportional to the number of polyominoes in the components, hence the total time for the first loop of STAPACK is O(k log k + m2 + P) Finding all,the,overlaps,""after the first loop of STAPACK is carried out takes O(Pq) time, where q is the number of overlaps.,""",,,,
"Because at that stage there are no more overlaps along edges of the triangulation graph, q is usually very small, hence this step can be considered as taking time O(P).1 The stress model is solved u,sing,stress ma,""jorization [20].,""",,,,
"The technique works by bounding (1) with a series of quadratic functions from above, and the process of finding an optimum becomes that of finding the optimum of the series of quadratic functions, w,hich,involves,""solving linear systems with a weighted Laplacian of the proximity graph.,""",,,,
We solve each linear system using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm.,,,,
"Because we use the Delaunay triangulation as our proximity graph and it has no more than 3k ??6 edges, each iteration of the conjugate gradient algorithm takes time O(k).",,,,
"Hence the total time to minimize one stress function is O(ckS), where S is the average number of stress majorization iterations, and c the average number of iterations for the conjugate gradient alg,orith,""m.,"",",,,,
"Therefore, overall, Algorithm 1 takes O(t(ckS + k log k + m2 + P)) time, where t is the total number of iterations in the two main loops in Algorithm 1.",,,,
"The most expensive term is tm2 , relating to the underlying mesh.",,,,
"This value is dependent on the size of the polyominoes, because if the polyomino size is small, the underlying mesh should also be finer to be able to offer fine-grain collision detection.",,,,
"Typically a value of m = 500 is more than enough to offer fine resolution collision detection, and a smaller value such as m = 100 is often enough for the number of disconnected components we typica,lly n,eed to ha,""ndle (< 100), considering that we filter out singleton components.,""",,,,
"In practice, with these parameter settings the algorithm runs quickly enough to support layout updates every few seconds.",,,,
"For example, for a graph with 31 disconnected components, 199 nodes (tweets) and 1645 edges, the STAPACK algorithm (with m = 500) removes overlap and underlap in 77 iterations and took 1.2 seconds.,"","",,",,,,
The code was written in C and ran on an Intel Xeon E5506 2.13GHz CPU.,,,,
"5 TwitterScope System Overview We implemented a prototype system, called TwitterScope, based on the visualization technique described above.",,,,
Its aim is to provide a dynamic view of tweets about a given keyword or set of keywords.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
6 shows an overview of TwitterScope.,,,,
It collects data using Twitter's streaming API interface.,,,,
"TwitterTM offers multiple streaming APIs, including the Spritzer, which provides a small sample (around 1%) of all tweets, and the Filter API which allows up to 400 keywords.",,,,
We used the latter.,,,,
Data is collected continuously and stored permanently.,,,,
"This supports queries over any time period after the collector started running, which is crucial for repeatable experiments and historical review.",,,,
"The data collector runs in the background, and is independent of the analysis and layout/mapping modules.",,,,
At the end of each minute the collector writes to a new file.,,,,
"Tweets for each day is stored in a separate directory containing 1440 files, one per minute.",,,,
"In parallel with the data collector, a semantic analyzer finds stored tweets matching a specific keyword and outputs a similarity m atrix.",,,,
"By applying a t hreshold, we can ensure that the matrix is sparse.",,,,
The system uses the techniques described above to produce a map of the tweets.,,,,
"The graph representation of this matrix is embedded, taking into account the layout in the previous time step, using the dynamic graph layout algorithm that keeps the component layout stable across,""time,"",and also,""uses the stable packing algorithm when arranging disconnected components.,""",,,,
"This information is used to derive clusters, which in turn are used to produce a map of the tweets.",,,,
"In addition, the system produces a list of the top keywords in the tweets of a cluster which can be used to summarize the cluster.",,,,
"The final results are pushed to the web server as JSON files, and show up on the user's browser continuously.",,,,
"The analysis and layout/mapping are run once per minute, partly because too frequent changes can disorient the user, but also because of the way the data collection is set up to generate one new fil,e per,minute.,"",""",,,,
"In certain cases, the dominance of some topics and the sparsity of tweets in others cause the layout of the graph to have an extreme aspect ratio.",,,,
This is not surprising because the stable packing algorithm attempts to maintain existing proximity information.,,,,
"Therefore, to readjust the aspect ratio, we periodically repack afresh.",,,,
"5.1 Passive and Active Modes of Usage To make the system available to a broad audience, we implemented the interactive front-end in JavaScript and HTML5, that run in most web browsers.",,,,
"From the user's point of view, TwitterScope has two modes.",,,,
"In passive mode, it runs in the background and makes overviews for monitoring the given keywords.",,,,
The most recent matching tweets are shown in a rolling text panel at the top of the screen.,,,,
"We also highlight each tweet in turn, enlarging its thumbnail image and displaying its text.",,,,
"To prevent expanded thumbnails from occluding nearby nodes, we apply fisheye-style radial distortion to move neighbors away from the highlighted node.",,,,
"More specifically, let the nominal size of the highlighted node j be w( j), we want the new position for node i to be along the ray from node j to node i, but further away: where a and b are paramet,ers t,o be deci,""ded.,""",,,,
Thus the amount of displacement decays to zero as ||xi ??x j || ????,,,,
"If node i is very close to j, we still want it to be visible, so we set it to be at the boundary of the bounding box of j: f (0) = w( j)/2 Finally we want the displacement function to decay quickly,,so w,e set f (,""w( j)) = f (0)/2.,""",,,,
Substituting (4) and (5) into (3) gives a = w( j)/2 and b = 1/w( j).,,,,
Fig.,,,,
7 shows a sequence of screen-shots illustrating the dynamic graph layout algorithm that keeps the component layout stable across time.,,,,
In Fig.,,,,
"7 (a), a visualization of the landscape of TwitterTM discussion about ?쐖isualization??is given at 11:52 local time.",,,,
"At 11:53, some old tweets drop out, and positions of remaining tweets changed slightly (Fig.",,,,
7 (b)).,,,,
"Then four new tweets move in from top (four pink squares above the map, Fig.",,,,
7 (c)).,,,,
"Finally, in Fig.",,,,
"7 (d), the update finishes.",,,,
"Note that as dynamic update is underway, arriving tweets are continuously highlighted.",,,,
"For example, Fig.",,,,
7 (c) shows a highlighted tweet about architectural visualization in a country labeled ?쏛rchitectural/Analysis??,,,,
"Notice that by applying a fisheye transformation, pictures adjacent to the highlighted one remain visible.",,,,
"When a tweet is highlighted, we cover the rest of the canvas with a very lightly tinted ?쐖eil??to make the highlighted tweet stand out.",,,,
This accounts for the small difference in the background color of Fig.,,,,
7 (c) compared with the other three screen shots.,,,,
"Additional design details include use of haloes around the text of the highlighted tweet, as well as around country labels ??a feature employed in map design to make text stand out.",,,,
"In active mode, the interface allows the user to interactively explore the tweet landscape.",,,,
"By placing the mouse pointer over the icon of a tweet, the user can see its text; \x0cclicking on the icon gives a list of actions to choose from, including retweeting; navigating to the TwitterTM p,age o,f the per,""son who sent the tweet; following a link given in the tweet; saving the tweet (and emailing saved tweets); or translating the tweet (if it is in a foreign language).,""",,,,
The global view displays all of the tweets associated with a set of keywords.,,,,
"To drill down further, the user can type a term and have the system track it.",,,,
"Each tweet containing the term will be indicated by a disk behind the icon, and as new tweets come in, this term will be continuously tracked and matched tweets will be highlighted.",,,,
5.2 Recalling and Tracking Historical Data TwitterScope also provides an historical perspective.,,,,
On the left of the display is a time series graph of the number of tweets per hour during the last 24 hours.,,,,
"Mousing over the time series shows the time and number of tweets, as well as a list of keywords describing the messages at that time frame; clicking on the graph moves the display to the correspondi,ng ti,""me, allow"",""ing the user to investigate tweets that were made then.,""",,,,
"To make the keywords more meaningful and specific to a time frame, we need to do more than just count the top words of all the tweets at that time.",,,,
"Certain common words show up very frequently, make a list of top keywords uninformative.",,,,
"For example, words such as ?쐅ood, great, sad, morning, evening??frequently appear when monitoring tweets matching the words ?쐍ews??",,,,
"While these words are filtered out, we take the additional measure of finding unique words, conditioning on the baseline distribution of all words in tweets.",,,,
"Specifically, we take a moving time window of N tweets that appeared prior to this time frame, merge with the new tweets, and calculate the tf-idf of all words in the tweets that appear in this time,fram,""e.,"",",,,,
We then take words that have the highest tf-idf ranking as the keywords for this time frame.,,,,
"A larger value of N should capture keywords that appeared persistently in a large time window (e.g., if we take all tweets in the last 12 months, then the word ?쐔rayvon??could appear near the top i,n Mar,ch 2012).,"",""",,,,
A smaller value of N emphasizes the more ?쐀ursty??nature of tweets.,,,,
"N is an adjustable parameter in our system, and the default N = 2000 performs well for capturing changes between consecutive frames.",,,,
Fig.,,,,
"8 (top) shows keywords for the time frame at 4:02 am (EST), March 31, 2012.",,,,
The words ?쏷hailand?? ?쐊ill??and ?쐀ombing??should catch the user's attention.,,,,
"Clicking on the time frame reveals that a bombing incident happened in Thailand, with a topic country entitled ?쏷hailand..attacks..injured??",,,,
Clicking on the highlighted tweet would take the user to a news story at the USA TODAY website about the bombing.,,,,
"If a term is being tracked prior to clicking on the time series graph, the matching tweets in that time frame will also be highlighted.",,,,
Fig.,,,,
9 illustrates the use of the tracking functionality on historical data.,,,,
"The word ?쐔rayvon??is entered into the ?쐔rack??search box, to track news on March 28, 2012 about the slain black teenager Trayvon Martin, and his killer George Zimmerman, first discussed in Sectio,n 3 .,""2.,"",",,,,
Fig.,,,,
"9 (top) shows the news landscape at 19:10 EST, there are tweets highlighted with blue disks behind the thumbnail pictures.",,,,
"In particular, one highlighted tweet is: ?쏰bama's son wouldn?셳 look anything like Trayvon Martin.??This was broadcast minutes earlier on FoxNews, when one commentator said, ?쏧f the President had,a so,""n, he wou"",""ldn?셳 look anything like Trayvon Martin.,""",,,,
"He?셝 be wearing a blazer from his prep school...?? in \x0creference to President Obama's comment a few days before, ?쏧f I had a son, he?셝 look like Trayvon,??and the fact that Martin was wearing,a ho,odie when,""he was shot.,""",,,,
"Then, around 19:18 EST (Fig.",,,,
"9 (middle)), tweets about a newly released police surveillance video of Zimmerman start to emerge (shown in a few blue disks).",,,,
"The video showed that Zimmerman did not appear to be injured after the shooting, even though he claimed self-defense in shooting Martin.",,,,
"At the same time, tweets about the FoxNews comments slowed (pink region and disks south of the highlighted surveillance video tweet).",,,,
"Throughout the evening, tweets about newly released video increase and become an important part of the news landscape (blue disks and country at the top of Fig.",,,,
9 (bottom)).,,,,
TwitterScope has been online for two years.,,,,
"During that time, the heaviest tweet rate encountered was about 100,000 tweets per hour for the term ?쐍ews,??following the Boston Marathon bombing event.",,,,
"The experimental implementation of TwitterScope has been more than adequate to cope with this packet rate, while allowing responsive interaction.",,,,
6 Conclusion We have presented a general technique for visualizing a dynamic graph of text packet streams in real time.,,,,
"The technique clusters packets into subtopics based on semantic analysis and, using a geographic map metaphor, renders subtopics as countries, with an attached textual precis.",,,,
The approach relies on placement algorithms that promote the stability of the drawing to aid a user's comprehension.,,,,
"In particular, we introduced a new packing algorithm to address the stability of multiple components.",,,,
"A prototype viewer for TwitterTM messages, TwitterScope, presents a real-time streaming visualization of tweets with messages grouped into clusters or ?쐁ountries.??Users can drill down into individ,ual t,""weets, or"",""inspect the history of tweets using a time series strip chart.,""",,,,
"We see two potentially useful algorithmic enhancements for our current approach, both related to visual stability.",,,,
"First, when we recreate the map, colors for countries are assigned without much consideration for stability.",,,,
There has been recent work on achieving stable color assignments that we would like to incorporate [27].,,,,
"Second, for certain topics, when we perform a periodic packing refresh, the map may change significantly.",,,,
"It would be good to avoid this discontinuity, algorithmically or visually.",,,,
We have successfully deployed TwitterScope as a visual search engine.,,,,
"Currently this searchable version is being tested within our lab, and allows arbitrary keyword search, using Twitter's search API, besides the set of fixed topics available in the public version.",,,,
"The arbitrary keyword search relies on a modification to the architecture presented in Section 5, including server-side query handling, but there is no change to the layout algorithms described in t,his p,""aper.,"",",,,,
"At present, back-end processes handle most of the data collection, analysis, graph layout and mapping.",,,,
"As part of making the system more flexible, we contemplate reimplementing some of these processes in JavaScript so the computing and networking load can be shifted to the client.",,,,
"This would mean shifting the clustering, mapping, dynamic layout, and component packing to the browser.",,,,
"While this does not seem easy \x0c18 Gansner, Hu & North Visualizing Streaming Text Data to implement efficiently, making these algorithms available in clients would open new possibilities for other,soph,isticated,""visualization tasks.,""",,,,

Individual visual features are indexed in this illustration to facilitate detailed explanations in Table 1.,,,,
"A BSTRACT In this work, we introduce SentiCompass for exploring and comparing the sentiments of time-varying Twitter data.",,,,
Our visualization design combines 2D psychology model of affect (i.e.,,,,
emotion) with a time tunnel representation.,,,,
"To illustrate our visualization design, two case studies are conducted.",,,,
They demonstrate the effectiveness of SentiCompass in achieving various tasks related to temporal sentiment and affective analysis of tweets.,,,,
"The interactive demo of our system is available at: http://youtu.be/ZaMF6VNO7tA Index Terms: H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Application?봘ser Interfaces; 1 I NTRODUCTION The growth,of o,nline soc,""ial media such as Twitter has facilitated more people to get involved in social events.,""",,,,
"Through posting microblogs such as tweets, people are able to express and share their opinions almost instantly.",,,,
"Therefore, the adequate collection of Twitter data can be used as an important resource for monitoring people's attitudes on global events such as sports matches or political elections.",,,,
Previous research in sentiment analysis [8] focused on analyzing and extracting affective information from Twitter data.,,,,
"Usually, such analysis aims to gauge people's opinions (e.g. positive or negative) or complex emotion states (e.g. happy, sad, stressed) conveyed by their tweets using text analysis methods.",,,,
"To visually facilitate sentiment and affective analysis, many previous works [15, 7, 6] abstracted ?쐓entiment??as a unidimensional variable ( i.e.",,,,
from negative to positive) for visualizations.,,,,
"However, such simple abstraction can not satisfy the need of more sophisticated sentiment and affective analysis.",,,,
"To improve this, some works [17, 18], attempted to incorporate pre-defined emotion categories from Plutchik's model [9] for visualizing discrete emotion states of Twitter data.",,,,
"However, in their visualizations, the relationships of different emotion states are still missing.",,,,
Questions such as ?쏧s ?쁭ervous??closer to ?쁲ad??or ?쁥appy???,,,,
??cannot be answered.,,,,
Recent psychology studies have underlined the multidimensional nature of sentiments.,,,,
"For instance, one of the most widely used affective model, Russell's circumplex model [4], considers ?쐓entiment??to form a two dimensional polar space (i.e.",,,,
the affective space) with two principal axes being valence (the level of pleasantness) and arousal (the level of activation).,,,,

"Therefore, neither the unidimensional abstraction nor the categorical representation can truly represent sentiments.",,,,
"To overcome this, Ramaswamy [10] combined scatter plot, heat map and tag cloud with the circumplex model [4] for visualizing 2D sentiments (both valence and arousal dimensions) of tweets using multi,ple v,""iews.,"",",,,,
"With his visualization, the representation of ?쐓entiment??is improved, however, the temporal information of tweets are not associated with the sentiment visualization.",,,,
"Therefore, the temporal variations of sentiments still cannot be visualized.",,,,
"In this work, we aim to address the discussed problems (i.e.",,,,
"representations of sentiments, temporal information) by proposing a visualization design called SentiCompass.",,,,
"2 V ISUALIZATION R EQUIREMENTS In the sentiment and affective analysis of tweets, many tasks require considering both dimensions of sentiments (Figure 2) together with the temporal information to di,scern,temporal,""sentiment patterns, which are not achievable by previous visualizations.,""",,,,
We aim to solve the problem in our visualization.,,,,
"In designing our visualization, our targeted data type is textual Twitter data collected over a continuous period of time tracking tweets on specific events.",,,,
"Typically, they contain information such as tweet text, time, user ID and user location, among which the tweet (used for computing sentiments) and the time are most important to our visualization.",,,,
"Here, we summarize detailed requirements of our visualization using the task model introduced by [2], in which visualization tasks are divided into elementary and synoptic tasks.",,,,
"Elementary tasks refer to individual data elements, whereas synoptic tasks consider a whole set or subset of data.",,,,
"In our case, each element is the 2D sentiment of tweets (i.e.",,,,
"the aggregation of tweets whose sentiments fall within a small angular range, see Equation 1 and Figure 2 for details).",,,,
"The list of elementary and synoptic tasks of our visualization is as follows: Elementary Tasks: [ET1] Visualize the number of tweets and the strength of a senti- Related Requirements [ET1][ET2] [ST1,][ST2,] [ST3][S,""T4] [ST3] [ST4] [ST4][ST5] [ST3][ST4][ST5][ST6][ST7] ment at a given time segment.,""",,,,
[ET2] Compare the number of tweets and strength for different sentiments at a given time segment.,,,,

"[ST7] For tweets on one or more topics, find out if any time frames have similar sentiment patterns.",,,,
3 H YBRID A PPROACH FOR S ENTIMENT A NALYSIS We use a hybrid approach which combines an affective dictionary with traditional supervised classification for estimating sentiments of tweets.,,,,
We adopt the ANEW (Affective Norm for English Words) dictionary [3] to estimate both dimensions of sentiments: valence and arousal.,,,,
ANEW contains affective ratings for 1034 English words obtained from empirical studies.,,,,
"For each word, the ratings consist of mean and standard deviation for valence, arousal and dominance.",,,,
"Here, we only use the valence and arousal ratings.",,,,
"To calculate the valence and arousal of tweets, affective signaling words (which are words recorded in ANEW) are first searched and identified.",,,,
And then we statistically weight both the valence and arousal ratings of multiple affective signaling words.,,,,
"Meanwhile, to compensate the affective dictionary approach, we calculate the polarity (i.e.",,,,
negative or positive meaning) of the tweet using Naive Bayes classifier [5].,,,,
"Eventually, for each tweet, both valence and \x0carousal dimensions are estimated, and then polar coordinates on affective space are calculated, which consist of the angle referring to a specific ty,pe of,sentimen,""t (see Russell's model [4]), and the radius indicating the strength of the sentiment (Figure 2).,""",,,,
"4 T HE V ISUAL M ETAPHOR OF SentiCompass Based on the requirements, we design SentiCompass to visualize time-varying Twitter data on 2D affective space.",,,,
The visual metaphor of SentiCompass considers the following four aspects.,,,,
2D Psychological Model of Affect.,,,,
"One of the most prominent dimensional models of affect is Russell's circumplex model [12, 4].",,,,
"This model suggests that sentiments are distributed in a twodimensional polar space with horizontal axis being valence (the level of pleasantness) and vertical axis being arousal (the level of activ,ation,"").,"",",,,,
Different sentiments (i.e.,,,,
emotion states) can be represented at any level of valence and arousal.,,,,
Russell's model has been most commonly used in testing the emotions of words [11].,,,,
"Besides Russell's model, Plutchik's model [9] offers a hybrid three dimensional representation of emotions that are categorized circularly from basic (outer circle) to complex (inner circle).",,,,
"The emotion categories introduced by this model are used by some previous visualization works [17, 18].",,,,
"However, neither of them considered ?쐓entiment??as a continuous multi-dimensional variable.",,,,
"In this paper, Russell's circumplex model is chosen, mainly because the proposed two principal axises of sentiment (i.e.",,,,
valence and arousal) are most commonly used in testing stimuli of affective words [11].,,,,
"In the future, we plan to investigate the dimensional model (rather than just emotion categories) introduced by Plutchik [9] and compare it to Russell's model [12, 4].",,,,
Cyclic Representation of 2D Sentiment Data.,,,,
"As suggested by the circumplex model, different sentiments are arranged in a 2D circular space by the levels of valence and arousal.",,,,
"In order to better discern the cyclic behavior of sentiment data, cyclic representation is adopted [1].",,,,
"In our case, our sentiment data are continuous valence (v) and arousal (a) scores of tweets.",,,,
"For every tweet, we first calculate its\x10polar in the affective space us\x11 coordinates p ing Senti罐i = arctan avii , Senti?i = (vi )2 + (ai )2 , where Senti罐i denotes a specific type of sentim,ent [,4] and Se,""nti?i denotes the strength of the sentiment (Figure 2).,""",,,,
"Then to obtain the cyclic representation, we calculate a circular histogram using the polar coordinates.",,,,
"For each bin of the circular histogram, we first count the number of tweets falling into the bin using Senti罐i .",,,,
"Assume bin j consists of N j tweets, we calculate the mean sentiment strength and standard deviation of strength using the following equations: Perspective Representation of Time Tunnel.",,,,
"To incorporate the temporal dimension, we borrow the idea of ?쐃vent tunnel??intro-duced in [13] and ??D time helix??introduced in [14], together with the ?쐎ne-point perspective projection??that is,typi,cally use,""d in drawing (i.e.,""",,,,
parallel lines are converged at one vanishing point).,,,,
"As shown in Figure 2, we represent time as a cylindrical tunnel, with different time periods represented by time rings (top view in Figure 2), and then we apply perspective projection to add the tim,e dim,ension in,""to our 2D visualization (perspective view in Figure 2).,""",,,,
"In the perspective view, the smaller the time ring, the more remote the time, which can be imagined as looking into a time tunnel with the earliest time located at the furthest end of the tunnel.",,,,
Figure 2: The visual metaphor of SentiCompass combining circumplex model and perspective time tunnel representation.,,,,
Color Coding.,,,,
"In addition to the cyclic representation of sentiment, we use two pairs of complimentary colors (see colors of Sentiment Wheel in Figure 1) to represent two dimensions of sentiment: Valence (green t,o red,"", indicat"",""ing pleasant level) and Arousal (blue to yellow, indicating activation level).,""",,,,
"Cold colors such as blue, green indicate low level, whereas warm colors such as red, yellow indicate high level.",,,,
5 V ISUAL M APPING AND I NTERACTION The detailed features of SentiCompass are indexed and labeled in Figure 1.,,,,
We summarize individual features based on our visualization requirements in Table 1.,,,,
Features that support interactions are marked by _.,,,,
"For the rest of this section, we briefly describe the interaction support of SentiCompass based on the main motivations of interaction [16].",,,,
Select and Explore Different Time Segments.,,,,
"We have two linked Time Ring navigation controls in our visualization: one is the orange box on the top view, the other is the green button in the middle of the perspective view (Figure 1).",,,,
"Through dragging the box or clicking on the button, users are able to select and inspect data in earlier or later time segments (Figure 4(b) and 4(c)).",,,,
This is to mimic the effect of going backward or forward in the time tunnel in the perspective representation (see Figure 2).,,,,
Reconfiguration of Views.,,,,
"We design Start Pin to allow the variable beginning of the rectangular view, which is the breaking and unfolding point of the perspective view (Figure 1).",,,,
The advantage of this is to allow the reconfiguration of the rectangular view based on data characteristics.,,,,
"For instance, users may choose to break the perspective view at the position where not much sentiment information is shown.",,,,
We also provide Window Size Slider to adjust the displayed number of time rings in the perspective view based on users??preference or data characteristics.,,,,
Abstract and Elaborate Time Segmentations.,,,,
We provide Time Zoom in/out buttons to allow the selection of time segmentations at desired granularities (either finer or coarser).,,,,
"For instance, Figure 1 (10 min interval) and Figure 3(b) (20 min interval) show different segmentations of the same dataset.",,,,
"Meanwhile, by clicking the Time Zoom-out button, users are able to see the most abstract level of data, i.e.",,,,
the sentiments of tweets during the entire time period without time segmentation.,,,,
The lower-right corner of Figure 1 shows an example of such abstract overview.,,,,
6 C ASE S TUDIES We collected tweets via Twitter streaming API for two case studies.,,,,
"In our case studies, we will show SentiCompass enables various \x0ctasks (see section 2) that were not achievable by previous work related to sentiment visualizations [17, 18].",,,,
"Case study 1 Our first case study is based on tweets collected on 22 Nov, 2014 for two rugby union matches: Wales vs. New Zealand (#WAvNZ, 5:40-7:10pm (UTC)) and Ireland vs. Australia (#IRvAU, 4:40-,6:10p,m (UTC)).,"",""",,,,
"For #WAvNZ (Figure 3(b)), the highlighted time ring shows: at the beginning of the second half of the match (6:20-6:30pm), the most dominant sentiment is tense, i.e.",,,,
"the orange pick in the highlighted time ring, occupying 17% of the total tweets during 6:20-6:30pm ([ET1, ET2, ST4, ST5]), which is probably because both teams scored the same for the first half, ye,t New,Zealand,""out performed Wales by 18 points in the second half.,""",,,,
"In Figure 3, we can see compared to the match #IRvAU, the volume of tweets for #WAvNZ is much higher ([ST3]), with more tweets collected at the second half of the match.",,,,
"Overall, the distributions of sentiments for two matches follow similar patterns ([ST2, ST6, ST7]).",,,,
"However, for #WAvNZ, there are more tweets corresponding to nervous and tense ([ST1, ST5, ST6]), which is consistent with the match result.",,,,
"Case study 2 Our second case study is based on tweets collected during 2013 Australian election period (5-7 Sept, 2013 (UTC+10)).",,,,
"The election day was 7 Sept, therefore the dataset consists of tweets collected on the election day plus two days before and after the election.",,,,
"The sentiments of 122,393 tweets are analyzed and visualized in Figure 4.",,,,
The election day is highlighted to facilitate comparison.,,,,
"As shown in Figure 4, before the election (Figure 4(b)), the sentiments are separated into two opposite extremes ([ST2]): one being unpleasant to sad ([ST1]), the other being pleasant to con- tent (,[ST1],""), with m"",""ore percentage of tweets at sad ([ET1, ET2, ST1]).,""",,,,
"On the election day, the volume of tweets are the highest ([ST3]), and the separation of sentiments have disappeared ([ST4]).",,,,
"The majority of tweets exhibit excited and elated with high sentiment strength ([ET1, ET2]).",,,,
"After the election (Figure 4(c)), sentiments become more distributed ([ST4]); however compared to before election, higher percentage of tweets express high valence (pleasantness) and low arousal (ca,lm an,d relaxed,"") ([ST2, ST4, ST5]).,""",,,,
"We also compare the sentiments of the election dataset to the #WAvNZ rugby match dataset using the abstract data overviews ([ST6, ST7]).",,,,
"We can see that (Figure 4(a) and lower-right corner of Figure 1) although both polarized in terms of valence, the majority of tweets on rugby match express sentiments towards low arousal, e.g. calm,and r,""elax,wher"",""eas the majority of tweets on election express high arousal, e.g. elated and excited, which is consistent with the natures of these two different types of events.,""",,,,
"7 C ONCLUSION In this work, we introduced SentiCompass for visualizing the sentiments of time-varying Twitter data.",,,,
Our visualization design combines the circumplex model of affect with the time tunnel representation.,,,,
Our two case studies show the effectiveness of SentiCompass in achieving various tasks related to temporal sentiment and affective analysis of tweets.,,,,

"Visual Sentiment Analysis of RSS News Feeds Featuring the US Presidential Election in 2008 Franz Wanner, Christian Rohrdantz, Florian Mansmann, Daniela Oelke, Daniel A. Keim University of Konstanz,,Germa,ny firstn,""ame.lastname@uni-konstanz.de ABSTRACT The technology behind RSS feeds offers great possibilities to retrieve more news items than ever.,""",,,,
"In contrast to these technical developments, human capabilities to read all these news items have not increased likewise.",,,,
"To bridge this gap, this paper presents a visual analytics tool for conducting semi-automatic sentiment analysis of large news feeds.",,,,
"While the tool automatically retrieves and analyzes RSS feeds with respect to positive and negative opinion words, the more demanding news analysis of finding trends, spotting peculiarities and putt,ing e,vents int,""o context is left to the human expert.,""",,,,
For a solid analysis the news similarity filter enables highlighting of similar or redundant news items.,,,,
"A case study about news related to the US presidential election in 2008 shows how the visual interface of the tool empowers the analyst to draw meaningful conclusions without the effort of reading a,ll ne,ws postin,""gs.,""",,,,
"Author Keywords sentiment analysis, opinion mining, information visualization, visual analytics ACM Classification Keywords H.5.2 Information Interfaces and Presentation: Miscellaneous INTRODUCTION,The w,eb is the,""largest information source in the world.,""",,,,
One major aspect of the web is to bring news from all over the world via RSS feeds instantaneously on your screen.,,,,
"Apart from passive usage of the web as a media, web 2.0 technology helps more and more people to actively contribute to this valuable information source by creating content in an easy way.",,,,
"There are many possibilities to take an active part in the web: blogs, reviews and other ways to state comments.",,,,
Analyzing news stories and user generated content is of huge importance for many people and organizations.,,,,
"Economic analysts, for example, would like to find consumer and public opinions on their products and services.",,,,
"Likewise, potential consumers seek experiences of existing users before making a purchase decision or afterwards to cope with the product's shortcomings or praise its functionality.",,,,
"Furthermore, politicians want to find out their public reputation, the manner the news write about them, and the reaction of the public on these articles.",,,,
"Since public opinion polls are an expensive undertaking, our goal is to offer a semi-automatic approach by mining the web for particular key words, conducting sentiment analysis on the text to asses,s how,positive,""or negative a particular news postings is, and then to present the information in a visual exploration tool.,""",,,,
"While our approach is not suitable to completely replace a thoroughly conducted opinion poll due to the lack of accuracy, it has also some unique advantages, namely low costs and the possibility to,conti,nuously m,""onitor a particular subject in real-time.,""",,,,
Knowing at an early stage that consumers have a problem with a sub-component of a product gives the company more time to react appropriately and to avoid damage to valuable trade marks.,,,,
"In this paper, we demonstrate a novel way of using text analysis methods in combination with a visual representation.",,,,
"On the one hand, this system automatically evaluates the emotional content of a news posting.",,,,
"On the other hand, the visual interface empowers the human expert to draw meaningful conclusions, to selectively read a few news postings with strong emotional content, to discover trends, and to ga,in an,overview,""of the development of chosen topic in the media.,""",,,,
To exemplify our tool we have a closer look at the news coverage in the web of the 2008 US presidential election.,,,,
"Out of 50 chosen political RSS newstickers, we retrieved all RSS articles containing at least one of the following key words: ?쏰bama?? ?쏮cCain?? ?쏝iden??and ?쏱alin??as well as ?쏡emocrat??and ?쏳,epub,""lican??,"",",,,,
"Thereupon, the articles are automatically evaluated with respect to the contained positive and negative opinion words, resulting in a normalized sentiment score for each article.",,,,
"For presentation purposes, these articles are then visualized on a daily timeline using symbols to encode the contained key words.",,,,
"The vertical position of each symbol is defined by the article's sentiment score, which makes strong emotional news more visible.",,,,
"Furthermore, we demonstrate an interactive feature to show relations between the news items to track the development of a specific topic.",,,,
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In section  \x0cRelated Work text and sentiment analysis methods and visual interfaces for them are discussed.,,,,
"The next section Visual Sentiment Analysis then presents our processing, visualization, and interaction approaches for analyzing the news coverage of the 2008 US presidential election.",,,,
"Afterwards, section Results shows how some interesting topics about the candidates and their parties manifest in our visualization.",,,,
By summarizing our contributions we draw our conclusions in the last section.,,,,
Two further approaches being related to our work are [2] and [11].,,,,
Both of them analyze blogs and / or newspaper articles with respect to their political orientation.,,,,
"However, none of the approaches explores the development over time as we do.",,,,
Instead they both focus on analyzing the link structure between the different blogs respectively the citation patterns for newspaper articles.,,,,
"In addition, [11] takes into account how emotionally charged a post is.",,,,
Sentiment Analysis RELATED WORK Text Analysis The visualization and visual analysis of textual data is increasingly attracting interest in different application domains.,,,,
"Many of the early approaches in that area dealt with the visualization of retrieval results (see e.g., VIBE [22] or InfoCrystal [27]).",,,,
"Furthermore, a variety of techniques concentrate on the visualization of large document collections, most of which are based on dimensionality-reduction methods (see e.g. WebSOM [23], Galaxies and T,hemeS,cape of I,""N-SPIRET M [30], or [9]).,""",,,,
"In contrast to this, text feature visualization techniques visualize single documents in detail and show the distribution of specific text features across the text.",,,,
"Prominent examples among these are e.g. TileBars [16], Seesoft [3], the FeatureLens [6], and Literature Fingerprinting [19].",,,,
But also [1] and the Compus system of Fekete and Dufournaud [7] are worth being mentioned: As opposed to the other techniques they offer the possibility to visualize several text features at once.,,,,
Relatively few approaches tackle the problem of visualizing temporal variations across a set of documents as we do in this paper.,,,,
One example for such an approach is the wellknown ThemeRiver visualization [15] that reveals the development of topics over time in a river-like graphic.,,,,
According to the metaphor each topic is represented as one colored ?쐁urrent??in the ?쐒iver??that flows in the direction of the timeline from left to right.,,,,
To allow for several different themes to be displayed at once the currents are stacked on top of each other.,,,,
The thickness of a current at a specific point in time represents the strength of the topic in the associated documents.,,,,
TimeMines [28] and Narratives [8] are examples for visualizations that are based on standard line charts.,,,,
TimeMines automatically determines keywords and judges those keywords with respect to their temporal significance in the context of the corpus.,,,,
"Furthermore, keywords that show to have a similar development over time are grouped to form a topic.",,,,
Narratives presents the development of a specific topic over time and searches for correlated terms.,,,,
A similar concept is reported in [12].,,,,
The system BlogPulse (that can be found at www.blogpulse.com) monitors blogs and displays timelines that show how many blogs talk about a specific topic at a specific point in time.,,,,
"In addition, hot topics are detected automatically.",,,,
All of the mentioned timeoriented approaches have a common limitation: They merely display the development of the significance of keywords or topics over time.,,,,
Our approach goes beyond that by means of additionally revealing the sentiment of the documents.,,,,
"Within the abundant literature that exists in the context of sentiment analysis and opinion mining, some major tasks can be identified: ??Classification of the statements of a document (or a sentenc,e) as,subjecti,""ve or objective.,""",,,,
"(e.g. [29, 14]) ??Classification of a document (or a sentence) as expressing a negative or positive sentiment (or opinion).",,,,
"(e.g. [25, 5]) ??Feature-based opinion mining made up by two successive steps: First, the features (or attributes), that have been commented on, are identified.",,,,
"Secondly, the respective opinion that has been expressed on them is detected.",,,,
"(e.g. [17, 18, 26, 21, 20]) Note that our approach is not contributing to the area of automatic sentiment analysis but makes use of some of its standard techniques.",,,,
"However, we contribute to the development of visualizations for sentiment analysis.",,,,
"Related work in this respect includes [10, 24, 13].",,,,
"The visualization, which shows to have the highest resemblance to our work, can be found in [24].",,,,
The authors suggest to use bars to visualize how many positive respectively negative statements ??that comment on one of the analyzed attributes of a product ??exist within the document corpus.,,,,
Our work is similar in that we also use the vertical deflection of bars to encode the opinion that is expressed.,,,,
"In contrast to [24] however, in our case one bar represents one document instead of the summary of all sentences talking about a specific attribute of a product.",,,,
"Moreover, in our visualization the development over time is central, something that is completely omitted in all of the above mentioned approaches for sentiment analysis / opinion mining.",,,,
"In [10] customer reviews are visualized, too, but a Treemap representation is used to display the result of the analysis.",,,,
"Finally, [13] presents an adaptation of the Rose Plot visualizations to illustrate the affective content of a document.",,,,
"In addition to positive and negative sentiments, the documents are also analyzed with respect to the categories virtue, vice, pleasure, pain, power cooperative, and power conflict.",,,,
"VISUAL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS Data Processing The data we used was gathered from 50 different RSS news feeds, that mainly dealt with the 2008 US presidential elections.",,,,
The RSS feeds were retrieved every 30 minutes during a time interval of one month (10/09/2008 - 11/10/2008).,,,,
"For every news item in each feed we saved date, title and description, as well as the id of the feed.",,,,
"Next, noise was eliminated \x0cout of the title and description.",,,,
"With noise we refer to strings that do not carry any content, such as URLs or strings consisting of special characters.",,,,
The concatenation of title and description was then considered to be the content of the news item.,,,,
"Finally, we filtered out those documents that contained none of the following signal words: ?쏰bama?? ?쏮cCain?? ?쏝iden?? ?쏱alin?? ?쏡emocrat??and ?쏳epublican??",,,,
"More than 23,000 news items contained at least one of the six strings.",,,,
"Pairwise similarities between news items were calculated by applying a similarity measure, which counts the number of non-stopwords that two items have in common (normalized by the length of the lar,ger i,""tem).,"",",,,,
Although this is a relatively simple measure it works quite well for the short descriptive texts in the RSS news feeds.,,,,
"Another aspect of interest is the sentiment context of a news item, which is done by enriching each item with a sentiment score.",,,,
For this purpose we make use of a freely available list of words that evoke positive or negative associations [4].,,,,
We count the number of positive and negative words and evaluate the whole news item as rather positive if it contains in total more positive than negative words.,,,,
"Likewise, the item is evaluated as rather negative if it contains more negative than positive words.",,,,
"The absolute relation of positive against negative words normalized by the item's length, provides our sentiment score.",,,,
"One important point to mention here is that the appearance of a candidate, e.g., in a negative context, does not necessarily mean, that the item contains negative publicity for the candidate, but si,mply,that he a,""ppears in a negatively connoted context.,""",,,,
This becomes clear when we consider the example of news telling that racists planned to assassinate Obama (see section ?쏳esults??.,,,,
"This was bad news for Obama not about Obama, with a visibly negative connotation.",,,,
(negative).,,,,
Horizontal lines mark the position that a news item would have that is neither positive nor negative.,,,,
Coloring Everything that is solely related to the conservatives (Republican party) is colored in red and everything purely related to the liberals (Democratic party) in blue.,,,,
"Gray news objects relate both to the liberals and the conservatives, which basically means that both camps are mentioned within the news??content.",,,,
"Shape The use of different shapes for the object allows us to make a distinction between news items in which the first candidate of a party was mentioned, the second candidate but not the first cand,idate,or none,""of them but only the name of the party.,""",,,,
Figure 1 shows the visual appearance of the different shapes.,,,,
"Please note that we keep the horizontal interruptions that are utilized to mark news items that talk about the second candidate always at the same vertical position of each line (regardless of the v,ertic,al shift,""of the object that encodes the emotional score).,""",,,,
"This leads to a clear visual pattern of continuous white horizontal lines, if several neighboring objects refer to the second candidates only.",,,,
"Data Visualization The visualization on the one hand aims to give a meaningful representation of the data and on the other hand is intended to be an appropriate starting point for the interactive ex,plora,tion and,""discovery of interesting patterns.,""",,,,
Figure 4 shows a screenshot of the visualization.,,,,
Each line represents one day and each colored object depicts one news item.,,,,
The news item's emotional score is encoded by a vertical displacement of the news item.,,,,
"Colors encode whether the text mentions the Democratic party, the Republican party or both.",,,,
"Additionally, the shape of the news objects visualizes whether the first candidate, the second candidate or only the name of the party itself was mentioned.",,,,
The following passages describe each of those aspects in detail.,,,,
Placement Every news item is represented by an object in a 2D plane.,,,,
The position of the object within the plane depends on the date the news was published.,,,,
"Thereby, the day it was published accounts for the line it will be placed in (as each line represents one day) and the time of day determines its horizontal position within the line.",,,,
The exact vertical position depends on the sentiment score of the object.,,,,
According to this value an object is slightly shifted up (positive) or down Figure 1.,,,,
Symbols used to represent news items according to the appearance of certain keywords.,,,,
Opacity We paint our news objects with a relatively low opacity.,,,,
"That means they are partly transparent, which comes with two advantages: First, the problem of overlapping news objects is reduced.",,,,
In most cases every object is visible and can be differentiated clearly from its overlapping neighbors.,,,,
"Secondly, if multiple news items are put on top of each other, the overall opacity at this position increases, resulting in an object that is less opaque and can therefore be distinguished from obje,cts t,hat repre,""sent just one news item.,""",,,,
The situation that several feeds bring the same news nearly at the same moment in time is often the case when the news is very important.,,,,
That means that the less opaque news objects often represent news that are more important and surely more widely spread.,,,,
Figure 2 visually illustrates the above mentioned design decisions.,,,,
Republican.,,,,
"To exemplify our Visual Analytics technique, we picked five interesting discussions in the monitored RSS feeds.",,,,
"Palin abused power in Alaska On Saturday, 10th October, many negative news postings occurred about Sarah Palin.",,,,
Almost all articles deal with the topic whether Sarah Palin had abused her power in Alaska or not.,,,,
As demonstrated in Fig.,,,,
5 there is a high density of red shapes with two white bars symbolizing news postings about Palin.,,,,
Their positions below the baseline denote that mainly negative emotion words were used in these postings.,,,,
Only one exceptionally positive red news item sticks out in the visualization.,,,,
"A closer look at this posting reveals that it is a response from the McCain-Palin presidential campaign: ?쏶arah Palin acted ?쁶ithin proper and lawful authority??in removing the state's public saf,ety c,ommission,""er??,""",,,,
Figure 2.,,,,
Semantics of the visualization Interactive Visual Analytics The visualization is designed for an interactive data exploration.,,,,
There are several possibilities to interact with the tool: ??Zooming: Continuous zooming allows to analyze certain parts at a greater level of detail.,,,,
"??Details on demand: When the mouse is dragged over a news object, a tooltip appears containing date, time, feed id, and content of the item.",,,,
"??Similarity search: With a mouse click on a news object, the search for similar news items is started.",,,,
The news item itself and every other news object that is related to it is highlighted (please refer to section ?쏡ata Processing??for our definition of similarity).,,,,
Figure 3 shows an example.,,,,
??Filtering: The user can select the different candidates / parties he is interested in.,,,,
Another possibility to reduce the number of items that are displayed is to select one specific RSS feed.,,,,
Both filtering mechanisms can be used to analyze in detail the behaviour of one specific news provider respectively the development of news for a subset of candidates and/or parties.,,,,
Figure 3.,,,,
"After selecting one news item, similar items are highlighted in yellow enabling the user to track specific topics (low threshold) or redundant postings (high threshold).",,,,
"RESULTS First of all, we present an overview of all 50 monitored RSS feeds over a time period of 31 days in Fig.",,,,
4,,,,
"A predefined filter displays all news postings containing at least one of the terms Obama, McCain, Biden, Palin, Democrat, and Figure 5.",,,,
Media coverage dealing with the topic of Sarah Palin's abuse of power as a governor of Alaska.,,,,
Bad news for the Democrats Approximately one week before the US presidential election we detected a high appearance of news which included ?쏰bama??(see Fig.,,,,
6).,,,,
The sentiment scores of these postings were mainly negative and dealt with a plot to assassinate Barack Obama and 102 blacks.,,,,
"Note that the news are bad for him but not about him, meaning that a negative event is related to him in the news postings although the negative opinion words do not refer to him as a person.",,,,
"The used emotion words were so strong, that even in the overview it is possible to recognize the emergence of the negative news of that event on 28th of October (see Fig.",,,,
4).,,,,
"Note that although each RSS posting only consist of a few sentences, the few contained positive or negative opinion words are sufficient to provide clear results.",,,,
Further headlines of that day discuss the corruption scandal of a Democratic senator and result in negative headlines for the Democrats.,,,,
TV debate Obama vs. McCain In the middle of October the final TV debate between the Democrat candidate Barack Obama and the Republican can- \x0cFigure 4.,,,,

As shown in Fig.,,,,
"7, news postings of the event cover both candidates (gray) and generally have low sentiment scores due to the criticism of both candidates against each other.",,,,
The debate revealed little novelty with respect to each candidate's political plans after the election.,,,,
"Therefore, there were no strong positive statements about the event in the monitored feeds.",,,,
Figure 8.,,,,
Palin under attack after the elections.,,,,
"Further trends The Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is represented by blue bars with two interruptions, was not referenced often.",,,,
As it can be seen in Fig.,,,,
"4, he appears very rarely compared to the Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.",,,,
A further discovery was that some feeds show daily patterns.,,,,
"For example, one RSS-feed only sent messages in the morning at about 7AM, others broadcast their news during working hours and some feeds even switched the coverage of political events within daily,patte,""rns, whic"",""h is probably due to two editors each preferring news about one party and taking turns in writing news postings.,""",,,,
Figure 7.,,,,
TV debate Obama wins the election As you can see in annotation D in Fig.,,,,
4 the election day is dominated by gray bars.,,,,
"This is due to the fact that these news postings reported about election results in particular states, featuring scores of both candidates.",,,,
In the evening of the election day lots of news postings were received about the winner Barack Obama.,,,,
The density of news about the Democrats increased rapidly after the result was known and dominate the news for several days.,,,,
"Palin's wardrobe Although after the election the blue shapes increased immensely, some red negatively rated items stick out (see Fig.",,,,
"Often, the same news story is broadcasted in many different feeds (e.g., the above mentioned news about Palin's wardrobe).",,,,
"This is mainly due to the fact that some feeds immediately broadcast the news copied from a particular news agency, whereas other feeds broadcasted this information later.",,,,
Another feed resent the same news posting several times as shown in Fig.,,,,
9,,,,
CONCLUSIONS The main contribution of this paper is the combination of a sentiment analysis method with a visualization technique revealing the emotional content of RSS news feeds over time.,,,,
"Through textual filters, we focused our analysis on the 2008 US presidential election featuring positive and negative news items about the presidential candidates Obama and McCain, the vice presiden,t can,didates B,""iden and Palin and the two major parties.,""",,,,
"The timeline visualization builds upon three basic elements, first the attribute color denotes the political party featured in the news article, second, different shapes are used to distinguish betw,een t,he discus,""sed persons, and third, the emotional score of each RSS news article resulted \x0cnews items are copied from other news tickers, related RSS postings are often based on the text of the same announcement of a newswire and therefore often contain almost identical vocabulary.,""",,,,
"For the analysis of other content, such as product reviews or the full articles linked in the RSS tickers, more complex document similarity measures could be employed.",,,,

"INTRODUCTION Team messaging platforms (e.g., Slack [3] and Microsoft Teams [1]) are becoming increasingly popular in organizations as a means of team communication.",,,,
"These platforms are designed with similar features including public and private channels, direct messaging, instant chats, etc.",,,,
"Analyzing data generated by such platforms (e.g., conversation logs) is critical to understanding team communicative and coordinative practices.",,,,
"It can provide insights to learn how the successful team operation is constituted [6], and allow for gleaning relational links among team members which are significant to the effectiveness of inform,ation,exchange,""[49].,""",,,,
"However, the analysis of team conversation data is nontrivial due to two main reasons.",,,,
"First, the growing volume of such data and its heterogeneous nature (e.g., containing textual, temporal, and team member information) hinder users from grasping meaningful and critical patterns due,to in,formation,""overload.,""",,,,
"Second, multiple topical points may appear simultaneously during team communication, and individual conversational threads often interleave, making it challenging for users to follow and digest the,conte,""nt.,"",",,,,
"Visualization has been proven effective in exploring conversations in an intuitive and interactive manner, especially in the context of threaded conversation data where coherent posts are bundled up,in o,ne place,""(e.g., emails).,""",,,,
"Some work aims at presenting the structure of a thread to help users understand both structural and temporal patterns of threads [29, 23], and others employ analytical techniques to facilitate the i,nvest,igation o,""f topics and sentiment of threads [20, 26, 30].,""",,,,
"Although powerful in their applications, these approaches are not adaptable to the team messaging platforms where conversational threads are interleaving.",,,,
Visualization techniques targeted at non-threaded conversation data are under-exploited.,,,,
"As far as we know, some research has only been done in providing visual feedback of real-time chatting [9, 17, 31] and understanding transcribed spoken conversations [20, 21].",,,,
Little attention has been paid to sufficiently address the challenges in analyzing team collaboration or communication.,,,,
"To fill the gap, in this paper we present a design study to explore interactive visualizations for investigating team conversation data.",,,,
"Our primary contribution is the design and implementation of T-Cal, a visual analytics system assisting users with the discovery of patterns in team communication and activities.",,,,
"T-Cal borrows a user-familiar interface, that is, a calendar, that allows users to explore massive message logs at different time scales, such as year, month, week, and day.",,,,
"We further employ advanced analytical methods to disentangle interleaving conversations into different threads, and summarize their content from different aspects.",,,,
"For example, we extract keywords from each thread, and infer sentiment for each message.",,,,
"We also contribute a novel visual design, ThreadPulse, inspired by electrocardiograms to visualize conversational threads.",,,,
"The design is able to illustrate both overall activity trends and detailed information of threads (e.g., keywords and authors of each message).",,,,
"Further, it is scalable and can display relatively long and intensive threads.",,,,
"We situated our design study with conversation data from Slack channels [3], but we believe that the T-Cal design and our results are generalizable to other conversation datasets and team messaging,platf,orms (e.g,""., Microsoft Teams [1])  because their system functions, forms of data, and use-cases are very similar.,""",,,,
"We followed an iterative user-centered design process and involved users of different backgrounds such as team managers, human resource specialists, and knowledge workers.",,,,
"Two in-depth case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of T-Cal with real-world datasets and applications, including conversation logs within an industry research lab and communication of student g,roups,in a MOO,""C.,""",,,,
"RELATED WORK Our work is related to visual analytics techniques for threaded and non-threaded conversation data, and more generally, temporal text corpora.",,,,
Visualization of Threaded Conversation data The word threaded refers to the bundling up of a specific message and its replies in one place.,,,,
Threaded conversation data stores reply relationships explicitly.,,,,
"Such data is commonly seen in communication platforms such as forum discussions, email messages, and blog posts.",,,,
Visualization of threaded conversations has received considerable attention over the past few years.,,,,
"Various approaches have been proposed to visualize the complex hierarchical replying structures, as seen in Conversation Thumbnail [50], TreeTable [35], tldr [34] and Content-centered Discussion Map,[55],"".,"",",,,,
"Some other works [29, 44] aim to demonstrate both the hierarchical structure of threads and the temporal information of each entity.",,,,
"Recently, Thread River incorporates visual aggregation and focus+context techniques to extend the scalability of Thread Arcs [23].",,,,
"However, the aforementioned approaches do not focus on depicting the general distribution of conversations and details of each message at the same time, which is supported by ThreadPulse.",,,,
Many works employ text mining techniques to distill insightful patterns from thread content.,,,,
"For example, ForumReader [16] and Themail [45] integrate content-parsing algorithms into the exploration of flash forum and email archives, respectively.",,,,
ForAVis [48] employs sentiment analysis in the search and exploration tasks.,,,,
"Moreover, Convis [25] and MultiConVis [26] combine both sentiment analysis and topic extraction techniques to support the multi-faceted exploration of blog conversations.",,,,
"To meet specific tasks faced by online health communities, VisOHC [30] captures hidden dimensions of threads.",,,,
"Unlike the above approaches, T-Cal first borrows an advanced natural language processing technique [22] to disentangle interleaving conversations.",,,,
"Then, it employs sentiment analysis and keyword extraction techniques to analysis conversational threads from different aspects.",,,,
Another research direction is to understand social interactions in conversations.,,,,
"Some work utilizes a radial tree layout to explore user interactions and subgroup formulation in forums [27, 36].",,,,
Conversation Map [40] employs a node-link diagram to present social connections in the context of very large-scale conversations in email messages.,,,,
Perer et al. [37] showed rhythms of relationships using line charts.,,,,
Revealing interaction and collaboration patterns among team members is one focus of T-Cal.,,,,
"More importantly, our study also  targets understanding general trends of discussions as well as analytics and summarization of individual threads.",,,,
"Visualization of Non-threaded Conversation data In contrast to messages organized in threads, non-threaded conversation data does not have explicit reply relationships.",,,,
All the messages are usually presented and organized sequentially by their timestamps.,,,,
"Example corpus is transcribed spoken conversations, data in instant chatting clients, and messages in team messaging platforms.",,,,
Visualization techniques applied to non-threaded conversations are under-exploited in the literature.,,,,
"Several chat-based systems are designed to show visual feedback on the content of conversations, for example, Conversation Clusters [9], Chat Circles [17], and GroupMeter [31], which encourages soci,al in,teraction,""and expressive communication.,""",,,,
"In a specific application, ArgVis [28] employs interactive graphs to reveal structures of argumentation.",,,,
Techniques have also been developed to explore verbatim conversation transcripts.,,,,
"For example, ConToVi [20] demonstrates the dynamics of a conversation over time, and NEREx [21] helps discover the relations of named-entity pairs.",,,,
"However, the above techniques all target at specific applications or conversation data types.",,,,
They are different from analyzing conversation data on team messaging platforms where the data is large in volume and lasts across a long time span.,,,,
"T-Cal addresses these problems with a calendar-based design to visualize communication patterns at various time scales, including year, month, week, and day, each presenting a different aspect of th,e con,versation,""data.,""",,,,
Visualization of Temporal Text Data Our work is also related to techniques for visualizing temporal text corpora.,,,,
A major approach is based on a visual river metaphor for showing temporal trends in textual data.,,,,
"For example, one of the first systems is ThemeRiver [24].",,,,
"Similarly, TIARA [51] and ParallelTopics [18] incorporate the LDA algorithm [11] into the river-based design to reveal temporal changes of topics.",,,,
"TextFlow [14] extends TIARA to a more powerful visualization for analyzing topic evolution, critical events, and keyword correlation.",,,,
"More advanced analytics have been applied and integrated with the visual river metaphor, for example, topic competition and collaboration [54, 43].",,,,
"Some other works employ hierarchical topic modeling to detect topics and reveal their evolution, such as RoseRiver [15], HierarchicalTopics [19], and Liu et al.'s system [32].",,,,
"In addition to topics, some systems focus on analyzing other aspects of temporal text data, such as diffusion patterns [53], sentiment divergence [13] and anomalous information [56].",,,,
The design of T-Cal has been inspired by many of the above systems in presenting temporal patterns of textual data.,,,,
"However, most of the previous works do not address the interconnections among users, messages, and threads, which is essential in our scenario due to the nature of communication.",,,,
"In T-Cal, the combination of information from the three aspects is seamlessly presented with the multi-scale calendar-based visualization and the novel design of ThreadPulse.",,,,
DESIGN PROCESS We followed a typical iterative user-centered design process [33] to develop T-Cal.,,,,
The entire process can be categorized into three stages as described in the following.,,,,
"In the first stage, we conducted a formal interview study to understand existing problems and challenges in analyzing conversation data from team messaging platforms, such as Slack [3], Microsoft Te,ams [,""1], and F"",""acebook Workplace [4].,""",,,,
"From the study results, we derived a set of design requirements to guide our development of T-Cal.",,,,
"For the second stage, we designed and implemented T-Cal in an iterative manner by involving end users.",,,,
We chose to use the conversation data generated by a research team using Slack in an IT company.,,,,
"The iterative development process involved several informal discussions with our users in the team, and a poster session within the company that was open to all employees.",,,,
We refined our prototypes based on the feedback obtained from the users and poster audience.,,,,
"Lastly, we conducted two case studies to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of T-Cal, which will be described later.",,,,
One case study was related to analyzing team communication patterns from the conversation data of the industry research lab that we closely worked with during the second stage.,,,,
The other case study was the application of T-Cal for investigating students??behaviors based on Slack group chat logs in a MOOC.,,,,
The second case study serves an evaluation of T-Cal outside of the application domain in which it was developed.,,,,
"DESIGN REQUIREMENTS GATHERING In this section, we describe the first stage of our iterative user-center design process in detail.",,,,
"Interview Study In order to understand how people currently explore Slack (or similar tools) and what challenges or opportunities to improve the experience exist, we interviewed six individuals who,were,frequent,""users of team messaging platforms.,""",,,,
We recruited individuals through reaching out to personal contacts and from members of public online Slack groups or mailing lists.,,,,
"As we were interested in understanding the experiences of people from a wide range of job roles, our interview sample consisted of three management or human resource (HR) professionals who worked fo,r a s,oftware c,""ompany, financial news website, and an architecture firm as well as three people in the software industry, i.e., one data scientist, and two UX designers.,""",,,,
Comments from the interviewees contained some common themes with regards to typical uses of the system and needs therein.,,,,
Interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes and interviewees received a $15 gift card for their participation.,,,,
"The interviews covered a variety of topics, starting with a general question about how people use and explore Slack conversations and why, for example, ?쏻hat do you currently explore Slack for???We,also,focused,""on information seeking behaviors including media search and archiving needs, and management strategies for dealing with a large volume of information.,""",,,,
"One example question was ?쏞an you share any recent examples of times when you have needed to go back and  find something???Finally, through eliciting specific examples, the interviews touched upon,chall,enges or,""areas in which Slack lacked functionalities that would be helpful to help people complete their work.,""",,,,
"For example, we would like to know how they keep up with conversations in Slack.",,,,
"The interviewer took detailed notes during the interviews, which were also recorded and referred back to later for analysis.",,,,
"Design Requirements Based on the interview results, we distilled the following design requirements.",,,,
R1: Disentangle interleaving conversations.,,,,
"One common issue that came up among both the manager/HR interviewees, the data scientist, and designers was the desire to disentangle interleaving conversational threads in channel discussions.",,,,
"Although Slack had introduced a highly-requested feature, i.e., threaded conversations, in January 2017 prior to the interviews, we found that across all six interviewees, the message threading was,not b,eing used,"".,""",,,,
"Reasons for this including confusion about where replies to messages could be found (in a separate pane), a feeling that starting a new thread required extra ?쐁licks??and was more burdensome than j,ust t,yping in,""the general message box, and a general sense that it ?쐂isplaces the chronological flow of chat.??Although participants found it hard to read through and tried to interpret conversations quickly from the chronological and one-size-fits-all chat window, as mentioned above, they continued to glean information from the chat this way.,""",,,,
"Hence, threading in its current state did not help to resolve the issue of separating out different topics and conversations.",,,,
"As a result, the disentanglement of interleaving conversations acts as an entry point for users to explore and analyze conversation data.",,,,
R2: Summarize and analyze conversations from different aspects.,,,,
"The three interviewees in higher level roles (manager, HR professionals) had a similar, high-level task of needing to get a sense of what conversational topics were being discussed across the larger,team,or compa,""ny as a whole.,""",,,,
"All three were interested in some form of sentiment analysis that would allow them to know what people were happy about, and more importantly, what problems and issues were cropping up.",,,,
"With the current design of Slack, they were doing this informally.",,,,
"For example, the software manager would browse channels manually to attempt to assess things like what people liked or disliked about the tools they were using.",,,,
"Through similar browsing behavior, the HR would like to know how the business overall was doing, what people were excited about, and what teams were communicating with each other.",,,,
R3: Reveal temporal patterns of team communication.,,,,
"One HR professional also mentioned the desire to gain a better understanding of temporal patterns of use among employees, particularly because the team was geographically distributed.",,,,
She referred to the concept of ?쏶lacklash??which was a reaction against Slack's tendency to send notifications at all hours and keep people returning to check it after work hours.,,,,
"She expressed a desire to see how late at night and early in the morning people were working, and working states at weekends, in order to make sure work-life balance issues were not becoming problem,atic.,"","",",,,,

(c) A Detail Panel allows users to browse raw messages of selected objects.,,,,
R4: Support advanced searching and filtering.,,,,
Searching and filtering are basic functionalities in data analysis.,,,,
"However, there are challenges in finding information with Slack.",,,,
"For example, one HR professional said, ?쏽ou might not always remember what a file was called.",,,,
"However, you have to do your best to remember what it was called or else keep on scrolling and scrolling.??Similarly, one UX designer reported one tedious task in searching.",,,,
"That is, when they did not label an image correctly and were looking for that image.",,,,
Searching information sent by a specific person and content might help in these scenarios.,,,,
"T-Cal SYSTEM Guided by the aforementioned design requirements, we designed and developed T-Cal, a visual analytics system integrating a series of analytical methods with a multi-scale visual interfa,ce fo,r analyzi,""ng team conversation data generated by Slack (Figure 1).,""",,,,
"In the following, we first provide an overview of T-Cal, and then describe its visual interface in details.",,,,
"T-Cal Overview Inspired by Wijk and Selow's work [52], we borrow a userfamiliar interface, i.e., calendar, to intuitively present conversation dataset at multiple time scales.",,,,
"Figure 2 shows an overview of T-Cal architecture, indicating the relationships between the front-end calendar-based visualization, and the back-end data storage, processing, and analytics.",,,,
"From the database storing the conversation data, the front-end visualization initiates queries to retrieve the information of users and messages within a certain timespan, which could be a year, a m,""onth,"",or a wee,""k.,""",,,,
The queries are specified by  Figure 2.,,,,
Overview of T-Cal architecture.,,,,

"Based on the retrieved users and messages, three analytical processes are performed, including 1) a conversation disentangling method [46] to split interleaving conversations into threads, 2) a keyw,ord e,xtraction,""algorithm called RAKE [39] to distill key information for each thread, and 3) a sentiment analysis method [10] to infer sentiment of each message.,""",,,,
"All the original data (i.e., users and messages) and the derived information (i.e., threads, keywords, and sentiments) are provided to the visualization as needed in views of different time scales (,""i.e.,"",""year, mo"",""nth, and week views).,""",,,,
...],,,,
"[, assuming that the number of ?쐖otes??passes the threshold described above.",,,,
"Consequently, the sentiment of this review snippet was changed to ?쐍eutral??",,,,
Note that we do not require a ?쐌ajority rule],,,,
[ here.,,,,
"Our rationale is that when an error is identified by many, it is better to correct it than to leave it in the system, even when there is no consensus on the solution.",,,,
Adopting the most suggested solution that passes the threshold seems sensible.,,,,
"4 User Studies To validate the effectiveness of OpinionBlocks in meeting our two design goals mentioned in the introduction, we conducted user studies to answer two sets of questions: \x0c1.",,,,
"How well does OpinionBlocks support real-world, opinion analysis tasks?",,,,
a) How well can users find important aspects mentioned in the reviews along with their associated sentiment?,,,,
"""b) How well can users find evidence behind reviewers opinions?""",,,,
c) How well can users get to the detailed facts and discussions as needed?,,,,
2,,,,
How practical is it for OpinionBlocks to leverage the crowd to improve its quality?,,,,
a) How accurately can users make amendments to correct system errors?,,,,
b) How willing are users to make such contributions?,,,,
c) How well do the amendments improve the system to benefit new users?,,,,
"4.1 Study Design To answer the questions mentioned above, we designed two identical studies and conducted them in sequence under two different experimental conditions.",,,,
Both studies were used to answer the first set of questions and questions 2 (a-b) by steering the participants to identify and correct system analytic errors.,,,,
"In Study 2, however, the user corrections submitted in the first study were incorporated to answer question 2(c).",,,,
"We compared the user performance between the two studies to assess any improvements (e.g., task time) due to user corrections made in the first study.",,,,
"We used disjoint sets of subjects between the two studies, i.e., a between-subject experiment design, to avoid any learning effect.",,,,
"Participants Since OpinionBlocks is designed to help end users, we conducted both studies by recruiting participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (called turkers from now on).",,,,
"After a pilot, we recruited 50 turkers for each study.",,,,
"Turker qualifications included being located in the United States, having done at least 50 approved Human Intelligence Tasks (HITS) on the site, and having over 98% approval rating for all HITS.",,,,
Each approved task completion was paid $2.59 US dollars.,,,,
Measures were taken to ensure that one turker could do the task only once.,,,,
Data Set We used Kindle Fire reviews from Amazon.com as our primary data source.,,,,
"We selected this data set for two reasons: First, it is a large data set that can be used to assess user performance in real-world tasks.",,,,
"Second, it is in a domain that may appeal to a general audience.",,,,
"""At the time when we conducted the studies, there were over 18,000 reviews on Kindle Fire, with more reviews added daily, indicating peoples strong interest in the product.""",,,,
"Overall, OpinionBlocks extracted 3034 aspects and 48,000 review snippets from the 18,000 reviews.",,,,
Tasks and Measures Each turker was first directed to an online survey that contained a set of instructions and questions about the tasks.,,,,
The survey started with a scenario: ?쏶uppose you want to buy a tablet.,,,,
You have just heard about Kindle Fire.,,,,
"""Youd like to learn more about it so you can make an informed decision.??The turker was then given a brief tutorial in \x0ca sequence of annotated screen shots of OpinionBlocks, explaining each inte,rface,element,""and function."""",""",,,,
"After the tutorial, the turker was given a link to launch the live OpinionBlocks tool in a separate browser window/tab.",,,,
"After OpinionBlocks was launched, the turker was then instructed to go to the next page of the survey to answer questions using the tool.",,,,
"There were a total of 27 questions in each survey, including fact-finding questions about the product (e.g., ?쏻hich aspect of the product received the most conflicting reviews?? and questions about,the,tool (e.g,""., ?쏦ow would you rate your experience using our tool to explore the reviews??.,""",,,,
A timer was started when the page of the survey containing the fact-finding tasks was loaded.,,,,
The timer stopped if all the questions on the page were answered and the page was turned to the next one.,,,,
The timed duration was used as a measure of completion time for fact-finding tasks.,,,,
4.2 Results We received 50 completed surveys for our first study and 51 for the second one.,,,,
"After reviewing each response, we approved all of them.",,,,
"On average, each turker spent 35.5 minutes on our survey.",,,,
1(a) How Well Can Users Identify Important Aspects/Sentiments?,,,,
Suppose that users are potential customers in the market for a tablet.,,,,
We designed two related questions to investigate this aspect.,,,,
"First, we asked them a yes/no question on whether they could make an informed decision on the tablet based on their use of OpinionBlocks.",,,,
"""This question was to assess the users overall confidence in their comprehension of important factors and their associated sentiment to influence their buying decisions.""",,,,
81 out of the 101 turkers confirmed that the information is sufficient for them to make a decision on the product.,,,,
One user also provided the rationale for his],,,,
[Yes],,,,
[ answer:],,,,
[there are more green bars than orange],,,,
[.,,,,
The second question asked the turkers to find the important aspects of the product.,,,,
"""This question was to examine whether a users understanding of the aspects was consistent with what the system provided.""",,,,
"""To do so, we counted the number of times that the users responses contained at least one of the top-three aspects identified by the system:""]",,,,
[screen],,,,
"[,]",,,,
[app],,,,
"[, and]",,,,
[book],,,,
[.,,,,
"""76 out of the 101 turkers produced correct answers, indicating user-identified main aspects were consistent with that of the system.""",,,,
"In addition to these two questions, we also used a set of questions such as]",,,,
[Which aspect has received the most conflicting reviews?],,,,
"[ to assess how well users can use OpinonBlocks to identify aspects with distinct characters (e.g., most positive, negative, and controversial).",,,,
"For these questions, for example, 66% of turkers in Study 1 successfully identified]",,,,
[screen],,,,
"[ as the aspect that received most conflicting reviews, while 72% turkers did so in Study 2.",,,,
"Moreover, the turkers were able to cite both positive and negative sentiments to substantiate their findings (see more below).",,,,
"Considering that there were 3034 aspects extracted from 18,000 reviews, OpinionBlocks demonstrated its effectiveness in helping users identify salient aspects of the product.",,,,
1(b) How Well Can People Find Evidence to Substantiate an Opinion?,,,,
"We designed three questions to ask the turkers about various review details (e.g.,]",,,,
[What products are the main competitors of the Kindle Fire?],,,,
[).,,,,
"For all of these factfinding questions, users were required to excerpt one or two sentences from the reviews to support their answers.",,,,
"""Two coders independently read all turkers responses (3x101=303 responses from two studies) and marked the responses (Yes or No) based on whether the cited sentences correctly supported the answer."","","",,",,,,
"""Krippendorffs alpha was computed to measure the inter-coder reliability, where alpha = 0.70, suggesting a good level of consistency between the two coders.""",,,,
We then computed the percentage of turkers that correctly found evidence to back up their answers (0.5 was used when the two coders diverged).,,,,
"Out of 303 responses, 274 were correct (90.4%).",,,,
"Clearly, OpinionBlocks was able to help users find specific evidence for opinions.",,,,
1(c) How Well Can People Get to Important Details?,,,,
"As described above, we learned that users were able to cite relevant evidence to back their answers.",,,,
"However, we also wanted to measure how accurate their answers were.",,,,
"To do so, two coders independently read each answer to judge whether it was consistent with the answers suggested by the original data.",,,,
The inter-coder reliability was measured at alpha = 0.82.,,,,
"The percentage of turkers that gave the correct answer was 95.2%, indicating that the majority of users were able to use OpinionBlocks to find desired details of the product when needed.",,,,
2(a) How Accurately Can People Make Amendments?,,,,
"During the studies, each turker was asked to identify and correct at least ten text analytic errors in OpinionBlocks.",,,,
Each turker was randomly assigned five aspects displayed in the visual summary to perform this task.,,,,
"From Study 1, we collected a total of 659 user-made changes.",,,,
Many of the changes were made by multiple participants.,,,,
"After removing the duplicates, we obtained 378 distinct amendments.",,,,
"Among them, 47 corrected misclassification of snippets by aspect; 347 corrected misclassification of snippets by sentiment; and 16 corrected both at the same time.",,,,
"After applying our rules for integrating user feedback, 49 unique amendments were incorporated into OpinionBlocks for Study 2.",,,,
Two coders examined the 378 unique changes and coded each of them to assess the correctness of the changes.,,,,
"Due to the inherent semantic ambiguities in interpreting the snippets, the initial independent codings had relatively low inter-coder reliability with alpha=0.36 for both aspect and sentiment placem,ent.,"","",",,,,
This low agreement in perception of aspect-based sentiment is also observed by Brody et al. [6].,,,,
Meetings were held between the coders to discuss a more consistent way of coding the results.,,,,
They identified two common cases of ambiguity and built a set of coding rules: (a) the interpretation of sentiment orientation should be anchored around the aspect first then the product.,,,,
"For example, one snippet stated ?쏿fter using the fire for a few weeks now, my ipad is gathering dust.??If this snippet is under aspect ?쐇Pad?? then it should be classified as negative, but if unde,r ?쐔,ablet?? i,""t then should be positive; (b) if a change \x0cmakes sense or does not make it wrong, count it as correct.,""",,,,
"For example, the snippet ?쏶oftware Controls ??I can see why the lack of external buttons would annoy some but for me it is not a problem??can be interpreted as positive or neutral.",,,,
"After applying these coding rules, we achieved good inter-coder reliability, 0.91 for aspect and 0.97 for sentiment respectively.",,,,
"""The averages of the two coders ratings were used in the accuracy calculation.""",,,,
"For aspect placement, 22 of the 47 changes were coded as correct (46.8%); while 247 of the 347 sentiment changes were accurate (71.2%).",,,,
These results suggest that people are more capable of fixing sentiment errors than aspect errors.,,,,
"Since the accuracy rates were not as high as we had hoped, we computed the accuracy rate for the 49 changes incorporated by OpinionBlocks, and found that these changes achieved an accuracy of 88.8%.,"","",,",,,,
"This demonstrates the effectiveness of our user feedback integration rules (section 3.3), and suggests that OpinionBlocks can be improved by crowd-sourced input over the use of state-of-theart machi,ne le,arning te,""chniques alone.,""",,,,
2(b) How Willing Are Users to Make Amendments?,,,,
We explicitly asked turkers about their willingness to make changes while using the system.,,,,
"From their answers, most users (95%) are willing to contribute.",,,,
We also asked the turkers to explain their main reasons for their answers.,,,,
"The reasons given by people who were willing to contribute fell into several categories: About 50% of the turkers said that they would like to help improve the quality of the tool for its better use,"".,"",,",,,,
"For example, one said,]",,,,
"[""Id be willing to spare a few seconds to improve a tool that I would gladly use.""]",,,,
[ Another commented:],,,,
"[""Those features are key to the tools use""]",,,,
[ and],,,,
[it can make the tool more useful and correct],,,,
[.,,,,
About 15% cited the community and social benefits.,,,,
The reasons include],,,,
[I thought this was a useful feature that made the tool more of a community-use tool rather than just an individual-use tool.?? and],,,,
"[""I think it will go a long way in making users of this app feel like theyre contributing in some way.""",,,,
It may even become a draw of sorts for the app.??About another 15% felt simply that it was fun and cool to correct things.,,,,
They mentioned],,,,
"[""Its fun!""]",,,,
"[,]",,,,
"[It was interesting to correct the errors, because I found myself trying to figure out why each incorrect snippet had been improperly categorized.??]",,,,
"[""Its cool that you can edit things.??""]",,,,
[I like organizing things.,,,,
"Especially when misrated reviews stick out like a sore thumb.??The majority of people who expressed their unwillingness to contribute (5% of participants) voiced their main concerns about the potent,ial a,buse of t,""he system:],""",,,,
"[If this was used by multiple people, it would end up being very abused.]",,,,
[;],,,,
[My only concern here is people messing with the system to improve reviews of their own products or make competitors look bad.],,,,
[; and],,,,
"[""its handy but should be checked by someone""]",,,,
[.,,,,
"Other unwilling participants just did not want to bother, or wanted to get paid:]",,,,
"[""Im not really interested in correcting mistakes.""]",,,,
[; and],,,,
"[""I cant see doing it out of the kindness of my heart.""",,,,
If it were on Mechanical Turk I could see doing it for a small amount of money.],,,,
[ \x0cOverall our results suggest that it is feasible to leverage the power of the crowd to help improve the system.,,,,
2(c) How Much Have User-Amendments Made the System Better?,,,,
"As discussed earlier, the turkers made many changes, of which 49 most common ones were integrated by OpinionBlocks.",,,,
"The incorporated amendments achieved an accuracy of 89%, thus improving the quality of the visual summary.",,,,
"To measure the impact of integrating the user edits from Study 1 on user tasks, we compared user performance in both studies.",,,,
"To do so, we performed statistical tests using the sequence number of the studies as the independent variable, and all the performance measures taken in the studies as the dependent variables.",,,,
"""We found that the turkers time for completing fact-finding tasks in Study 2 (M=768.1, SD=338.5) was significantly lower than that of Study 1 (M 916.6 seconds, SD =370.2), t98=2.10, p=0.04.""",,,,
Turkers in two studies performed equally well in term of finding correct facts about the products and relevant evidences.,,,,
"In addition, turkers were equally satisfied with our system in both studies.",,,,
"On a 5-point Likert scale, both obtained a median 4 satisfaction ratings, with 5 being]",,,,
[very satisfied],,,,
[.,,,,
"Overall, our results showed that it is practical to improve the system by leveraging the crowd to correct system errors, and the resulting improved system lets users perform tasks equally well, but,signi,ficantly,""faster.,""",,,,
"One plausible reason for the improved task completion speed is that in the improved system, there is less misplaced unhelpful information, so users do not need to waste time reading.",,,,
"5 Discussion Based on our study results, we discuss the limitations and implications of our work.",,,,
5.1 Limitations in Text Analytics OpinionBlocks has adopted several text mining approaches to analyze opinion text and glean useful insights.,,,,
It also leverages the power of the crowd to help compensate for system mistakes and improve the overall analysis quality.,,,,
"Nonetheless, due to inherent difficulties in text mining, our current approach presents several limitations.",,,,
One difficulty is to decide which review snippets to include and how ?쐀ig??each snippet should be.,,,,
"Currently, OpinionBlocks includes only text snippets following the sentence structure described in Section 3.2.",,,,
This means it may miss out many useful sentences that do not conform to such a structure.,,,,
"Currently, each snippet contains only one sentence.",,,,
This might be undesirable in situations where multiple adjacent sentences are used to express an opinion.,,,,
"The challenge is to balance the accuracy and recall when extracting review snippets, as well as balance the size of a snippet to provide sufficient information without overburdening the text analyti,c eng,ine or th,""e reader.,""",,,,
"To make the problem more difficult, striking such a balance may depend on factors particular to the data sets.",,,,
Another difficulty we have encountered is to determine which aspects to extract.,,,,
"Currently we extract aspects directly out of subject noun phrases, thus covering multiple categories.",,,,
"Besides aspects, such as ?쐓creen??and ?쏿pp?? which describe the Kindle Fire, we also extracted ?쐇Pad??which is a major competitor of the Kindle Fire.",,,,
"Other extracted aspects, such as ?쐗ife?? ?쐆usband?? and ?쐊id?? describe possible user groups of the Kindle Fire, and the aspect ?쐏roblem??falls in a generic category applicable to any product.",,,,
"Depending on users and use cases, some might want to see only the aspects pertinent to the product, while others may want to learn more about the aspects of competing products (e.g., aspects of iPad,in t,he contex,""t of Kindle).,""",,,,
More work is needed to make aspect extraction more meaningful and extensible.,,,,
"5.2 Common Ground versus Personalization In the User Studies section, we show that opinions are often ambiguous and that different people may interpret them very differently.",,,,
Building a ?쐅round-truth??of opinion summary is non-trivial and is unlikely to satisfy every user.,,,,
Allowing a certain degree of personalization may be desirable in support of individual users??decision making.,,,,
"Currently, OpinionBlocks allows each user to make amendments that affect only that user's private session.",,,,
"These changes are propagated more widely when the system administrator decides to do so, and only high-quality changes suggested by many users are adopted.",,,,
"Thus, the standard version of OpinionBlocks that every user starts with is quality controlled, even though users may make amendments to their own private sessions.",,,,
Complications may arise when merging divergent sets of amendments from many users.,,,,
This will certainly make a good future research topic.,,,,
"5.3 Potential System Abuse A few participants of our user studies expressed their concerns over potential abuse of a system like OpinionBlocks, including trolling or businesses manipulating the info,rmati,on for th,""eir own commercial gains through user amendments of opinion summaries.,""",,,,
"Currently, OpinionBlocks gives the system administrator a great deal of control over which amendments can be integrated into the system.",,,,
The system administrator can decide to tighten or loosen the threshold for integration or filter out changes from certain users.,,,,
"While further research is required to figure out how to best monitor and moderate user behavior, one approach is to the leverage the crowd themselves.",,,,
"As shown in our user studies, the accuracy of aggregated user amendments is much higher than that of individual changes.",,,,
This means aggregation of crowd input may help prevent or reduce malicious behavior.,,,,
"Currently our aggregation rules are very simple, future research is needed to develop more sophisticated rules, e.g., incorporating information such as the degree of difficulty of text analytic task,s and,user rep,""utation.,""",,,,
5.4 Fostering Healthy Online Review Communities Our work bears a major implication on the research in online communities.,,,,
"""Gilbert and Karahalios [11] pointed out two problems of current review sites: (1) large numbers of reviews are never read and in essence wasted; and (2) ?쐏ro??reviewers dominate the community and i,ts h,ard to he,""ar the voice of ?쏿mateur??reviewers."""",""",,,,
They call on system designers to nudge community members toward community-wide goals.,,,,
OpinionBlocks helps address both problems: It summarizes the reviews and helps users understand large collections of reviews.,,,,
It also fosters a democratic environment for others to contribute.,,,,
"In short, we have taken the first step to create a platform to foster a healthier online community where users can potentially help the system and help one another.",,,,
5.5 Value to Text Analytics Research It is also worth noting that our approach of marrying machine and human intelligence to text analytics produces invaluable assets for text analytics research.,,,,
"First, crowd feedback can be used as an indicator to identify ?쐆igh-value??areas for users.",,,,
"As shown by our study results, users mostly made corrections to the sentiment classification but only a few on the aspect classification.",,,,
This suggests that users may be more sensitive to certain types of errors than others.,,,,
"Moreover, user-submitted corrections can be used as a training corpus to help tune analytic algorithms.",,,,
"6 Conclusion We have presented OpinionBlocks, a novel visual analytic system that aids users to analyze large sets of opinion text.",,,,
It is uniquely designed to combine state-of-art NLP technologies with crowdsourcing to aid users in their real-world opinion analysis tasks.,,,,
"It employs multiple NLP technologies to automatically generate a fine-grained, aspect-based visual summary of opinions.",,,,
"As demonstrated by our user studies involving 101 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk, the majority of participants not only were able to use OpinionBlocks to complete real-world opinion analysis tasks,,but,they also,""exhibited a surprisingly high degree of altruism and concerns for the well-being of online review communities.,""",,,,
"As users gain value from the system, they become willing contributors to help correct system analytic errors and improve the system.",,,,
"Moreover, the crowd-assisted system enhancement significantly improved task completion time.",,,,
"Based on these findings, combining visual analytics with crowd-sourced correction is thus shown both feasible and effective.",,,,

"Besides leaving reviews below the video, some video sharing sites in China have provided a feature called danmu, which allows viewers to post ?쐋ive??comments asynchronously while watching a video.,"","",,",,,,
"These messages get superimposed on the video content, aligning with the video timeline regardless of their actual submission time to create a group viewing experience.",,,,
The danmu data reveals viewers??instant thoughts and feelings that usually coincide with a specific video scene.,,,,
"Content and service providers, as well as analysts can leverage such information to better summarize the content, characteristics, and potential values of the online videos.",,,,
Existing video summarization techniques are developed mainly in the multimedia domain [Rajendra and Keshaveni 2014].,,,,
"Most of them are automatic algorithms that aim to identify the key parts of a clip by analyzing its video, audio, and text (i.e., captions) features.",,,,
"These methods, although efficient, usually highly depend on the video's innate structure [Chu et al. 2015] and overlook viewers??perception and feelings.",,,,
"As a result, the storylines extracted from source videos may not be meaningful, interpretable, or exciting to audiences.",,,,
They still rely heavily on professional judgment to manually identify the informative and yet evocative video scenes.,,,,
"In this paper, we introduce a semi-automatic approach to visually summarizing a video stream based on danmu data.",,,,
"However, synopsizing a video stream based on danmu data is nontrivial.",,,,
"First, extracting useful information from massive danmu data is usually difficult.",,,,
"Danmu data is usually noisy, consisting of a wide variety of information from viewers??own opinions, questions regarding things in the video, to spamming messages.",,,,
"The language used in danmu messages is rather information, with many Internet slangs and emoticons.",,,,
"Therefore, pure natural language processing techniques may not be able to effectively differentiate the different types of danmu posts and extract the most relevant information for the synopsis.",,,,
"Second, combining and balancing heterogeneous information, i.e., visual data from a video and textual data from danmu comments, to guide the selection of essential video scenes / frames can be compl,icate,""d.,"",",,,,

"To address the above challenges, we introduce VideoForest, a visualization system designed to convert an input video stream augmented with danmu data into a visual summary of its content with highli,ghts,along the,""storyline under users??supervision.,""",,,,
The generation of video synopsis follows a semi-automatic procedure.,,,,
"First, an algorithm produces a visual timeline view of an initial foreststyle summary of the entire input clip by clustering related video sessions based on their graphical and danmu features.",,,,
The corresponding danmu posts are illustrated as the root system of the scene trees.,,,,
"Users can further explore specific video segments through this timeline view, and locate parts of interest guided by contextual information derived from the danmu data such as the topic, volume, and,sent,iment of,""user-generated comments within a given time window.,""",,,,
"Once a focal section of the video is selected, VideoForest creates a detailed video summarization based on a weighted, time-oriented circle image packing algorithm that captures both the storyline a,nd cl,imaxes at,""a finer granularity.,""",,,,
"In particular, this paper has the following contributions: ??Visualization Design and Algorithm.",,,,
"We introduce two novel visualization designs: (1) a compound timeline view that consists of a scene forest on the top, tag roots at the bottom, and session timelines as the ground in the middle, pro,vidin,g rich co,""ntextual information to help users skim and navigate through a video stream to find interesting stories and scenes; and (2) a visual summarization of key video frames based on a novel circle packing algorithm following a storyline.,""",,,,
Such layout preserves the temporal relationship between frames and ensures efficient use of the screen space.,,,,
??System.,,,,
"To the best of our knowledge, VideoForest is the first visual analysis and authoring system designed for summarizing videos based on danmu data in an interactive manner.",,,,
??Experiments.,,,,
We apply the proposed technique to the real world dataset and showcase several interesting summarizations created by expert users via our system.,,,,
2 2.1 Related Work Visualizing Time-Oriented Data Representing time-oriented data has long been one of the focal areas of visualization research.,,,,
"Among a wide variety of visualization techniques, this work is closer to those designed for showing multivariate time series data and streaming data given the characteristics of video and danmu comm,entar,""y.,"",",,,,
Visualizing multivariate time series data.,,,,
"Past research efforts in this area have mostly been devoted to visualizing, analyzing, and comparing data consisting of a set of numeric time-varying variables.",,,,
"Many visualization techniques are developed to illustrate the changes in numerical multivariate data such as Silhouette Graph [Harris and Schreiner 1997], Horizon Graph [Heer et al. 2009], Layered a,rea g,raphs [By,""ron and Wattenberg 2008].,""",,,,
MultiComb and TimeWheel [Tominski et al. 2004] applied radial arrangement instead of the conventional linear layout.,,,,
"Interactions has been widely used to help with the time-oriented data exploration, such as multi-focal in TrendDisplay [Brodbeck and Girardin 2003] and Chronolens [Zhao et al. 2011] and linked brush,ing i,n LiveRAC,""[McLachlan et al. 2008] and TimeSearcher [Buono et al. 2007].,""",,,,
"These techniques are helpful for revealing numerical features or measures extracted from a video stream, however, they fail to provide an interpretable summarization of a video due to the loss of co,nnect,ion to it,""s content.,""",,,,

The rapid growth of variety and complexity of streaming data has attracted more attention and led to more systematic studies in this area.,,,,
"For example, Cottam et al. [Cottam et al. 2012] presented a comprehensive taxonomy of streaming data visualization.",,,,
It revealed the relationship between changes in data and the interpretability of their visual presentations.,,,,
Tanahashi et al. [Tanahashi et al. 2015] developed a framework for creating the visualization of a storyline extracted from streaming data.,,,,
"Although prior work has provided useful design principles and inspirations for our system, none is developed specifically for visually summarizing a video stream and its corresponding danmu commenta,""ry.,"",,",,,,
"2.2 Visualizing Video Streams Video stream summarization has been extensively studied in the field of multimedia, with many techniques developed over decades [Rajendra and Keshaveni 2014].",,,,
"These techniques all try to achieve one goal, i.e., producing a condensed version of the raw video so that users can quickly grasp its content, but from different perspectives.",,,,
"Existing research has proposed to exploit internal data, external data, or a hybrid of the two as the basis of video synopsis.",,,,
"Internal summarization techniques (e.g., [Chu et al. 2015]) use information extracted from the video itself, such as video/audio/linguistic features to identify important scenes.",,,,
These methods depend highly on video innate structures and overlook viewers??perception and reaction.,,,,
"In contrast, external approaches rely on user-based information such as audience's preferences and interests [Kannan et al. 2013] to prioritize different content in a video stream.",,,,
"Manual labeling of video contents generated by authors of the videos or outsourced workers is required, which is expensive and less scalable.",,,,
"In this paper, we leverage danmu comments, a different source of user-generated data that is abundant and diverse, covering a larger scope of topics.",,,,
"The video summaries are most commonly represented in a matrix \x0cform, in which selected images are packed line by line in a temporal order [Lu and Grauman 2013].",,,,
Some advanced techniques can further illustrate the relationship among images extracted from the video.,,,,
"For example, Chen et al. [Chen et al. 2012] introduced a storyline visualization that uses arrows to suggest the flow of the narrative through the images arranged in a treemap [Shneiderman and Watte,nberg,""2001].,"",",,,,
ImageHive [Tan et al. 2012] organized images inside a voronoi diagram optimized to preserve the relationships among images and reduce visual overlaps.,,,,
"However, compared to our proposed technique, all these visualizations display images without showing much of the contexts such as references to the inner structure of the video and viewers??response,""s.,"",,",,,,
"In addition, none of them support interactions, and thus are incapable of guiding users to navigate in the video stream.",,,,
Visualizations have also been introduced to support video navigation.,,,,
"For example, SceneSkim [Pavel et al. 2015] enables efficient caption-based video frame searching.",,,,
VideoLens [Matejka et al. 2014] is designed to help with rapid exploration of large video collections.,,,,
"In comparison, VideoForest supports video exploration at a finer granularity.",,,,
"3 Visualization Design In this section, we introduce the detailed visualization designs of VideoForest, particularly of the timeline view and session summary view that aims to depict the video conte,nt at,differen,""t granularity.,""",,,,
"More specifically, the timeline view describes the temporal and semantic relationship between video content and danmu commentary at two levels.",,,,
"At the macro level, it provides an overview of all the video sessions and representatives of their associated danmu comments, while at the micro level it serves a lens into user-selected video segme,""nts,"",obtaining,""further details from video frames and individual comments.,""",,,,
The session summary view consequently packs these micro-level details into a glanceable form.,,,,
"In the rest of this section, we first discuss the design rationales behind the VideoForest system.",,,,
"Then, we present the detailed visual metaphors and encoding schema used in our forest-like design, including the scene tree, the session ground timeline, and the commentary root system.",,,,
"In the end, we describe the design of corresponding interactions.",,,,
"3.1 Figure 2: Visualization design of a scene cluster in the primary summary based on a tree metaphor: (a) the scene tree, (b) video timeline ground, and (c) commentary root system.",,,,
Design Rationales The visual design of VideoForest aims to help users gain the gist and flow of a video clip and explore the evocative parts of it based on previous viewers??spontaneous feedback.,,,,
We compile the following design principles to fulfill the above objectives.,,,,
R1.,,,,
Narrative summarization of heterogeneous data.,,,,
A visual summary of the video should preserve important contents based on viewers??interests.,,,,
It should contain sufficient information from both the video itself and the audience to support further pattern and climax analysis.,,,,
"In other words, this requires the visualization to process danmu posts (texts) and video frames (images) collectively.",,,,
R2.,,,,
Visual storyline unfolding.,,,,
An effective video summary should reveal the main plot of the video so that users can grasp the storyline at a glance.,,,,
"This requires not only extracting proper representative frames from the video but also capturing the innate relationship among these frames, which can be a challenging task.",,,,
R3.,,,,
Hot spots identification.,,,,
The visualization should highlight viewers??points of interest and enable a quick climax detection.,,,,
This requires understanding of individual danmu post and leveraging the meta-information derived from aggregated danmu data.,,,,
R4.,,,,
Easy exploration of video streams.,,,,
The system should enable flexible video exploration guiding by the aforementioned contextual information derived from the danmu data.,,,,
R5.,,,,
Visual clutter reduction.,,,,
Visual clutter should be reduced to maintain a neat and clear look of the summary.,,,,
This ensures the legibility of the video storyline and improves the system's usability.,,,,
3.2 Visual Metaphor and Encoding It has been shown that a well-defined visual metaphor is of great help in representing complex heterogeneous data [Cao et al. 2012].,,,,
"A video usually contains multiple plot branches, and each scene may be developed around some major branch.",,,,
"To resonate with this notion, the design of the primary view in VideoForest follows a tree morphology which encodes different components of a video summary via different parts of the tree (R1) as sh,own i,n Figure,""2.,""",,,,
"Here, the branches growing out of each tree is an analog of the successive video sessions that are semantically and emotionally related, since the clustering of session key frames takes both the ima,ge co,ntent and,""the contextual danmu sentiment into consideration (R3).,""",,,,
The tree is planted on a ground showing the video timeline.,,,,
"Its roots digging into the ground is an analog of the danmu commentary stimulated by the video content, and they are visualized as a temporal based tag clouds.",,,,
"The spread of trees of varying heights determined by the volume of danmu data (R3) indicates the development of the story in the video (R2, Figure 1).",,,,
"When users select a video segment, they zoom into the tips of the corresponding session branches in the primary view, and a separate summary of the selected segment is displayed as a twig trimmed fr,om th,e tree (R,""2).,""",,,,
"As shown in Figure 1, the whole visualization employs a consistent encoding scheme.",,,,
"Colors are used to encode sentiments, green meaning positive and red meaning negative.",,,,
The size of the danmu tags and image circles indicate their importance.,,,,
"Note that the importance of a danmu tag is measured by its frequency of occurrence in a period of time, whereas the importance of an image is determined by its information value calculated over a se,t of,features.,"",""",,,,
3.3 Interactions VideoForest system supports a set of rich interactions to facilitate an effective exploration of a video stream (R4).,,,,
(1) View switching.,,,,
"A user can switch to a raw video view (Figure 3(a1)), a temporal summary view of the whole video stream (Figure 3(a2)), or a view showing summaries of selected session(s) (Figure 3(a3)) by clicking,the c,orrespond,""ing tabs.,""",,,,
(2) New session generating.,,,,
Users can create a new session by clicking the ?쐁reate session],,,,
[ button on the \x0cFigure 3: The user Interface of VideoForest system consists of (a) the primary timeline summary view and (b) the session summary view.,,,,
"toolbar (Figure 3(a4)), and then brush on to select a video segment or multiple related segments on the new session.",,,,
(3) Smart summarization.,,,,
VideoForest enable users to select the danmu data of interest from the commentary root system to help refine the summary results shown in the session summary view.,,,,
(4) Scene Preview.,,,,
An animation related to a session shown in the scene tree or in the detailed session summary view will be shown in a tooltip when a user hovers the representative image.,,,,
(5) Highlighting.,,,,
Users can also hover on a danmu tag to highlight it.,,,,
"When the mouse is over a circular leaf on the scene tree, both the session image and its corresponding time window on the video timeline get highlighted.",,,,
4 System Overview The VideoForest system aims to create an interactive video summarization based on the video content and the danmu commentary data.,,,,
"The system comprises three modules, i.e., preprocessing, analysis, and visualization .",,,,
"In particular, the preprocessing module extracts a sequence of key information frames (a.k.a.",,,,
I-frames) and predicted motion frames (a.k.a.,,,,
"P-frames) from the video stream, computes the visual features of each image in the sequence, and re-assemble shots between two subsequent I-frames into animated previews.",,,,
"This module also performs preliminary text processing on the comments, including sentiment classification, similarity detection, topic assignment, and symbol categorization.",,,,
The results are converted into textual features that characterize each post.,,,,
"The analysis module takes the image and textual features as input and analyses video contents and audience reactions at three levels: (1) meta-frame, i.e., each I-/P-frame and the danmu messages pos,ted w,ithin the,""time interval around it (2) video coding session, i.e., the video segment and corresponding danmu data between two adjacent I-frames; and (3) scene cluster, i.e., successive sessions and related danmu data grouped by scenes.,""",,,,
The visualization module comprises two major video summarization views (Figure 3) : (1) the primary timeline view and (2) the focal session summary view.,,,,
"The primary timeline view contains multiple components, including two multi-tab views coordinated via a video timeline view in the middle (Figure 3(a4)), with the top view hosting the raw video (Fig,ure 3,""(a1)), a"",""temporal summary of the whole video stream (Figure 3(a2)), and summaries of selected session(s) (Figure 3(a3)) on each of its tab, and the bottom view displaying a synoptic danmu cloud and collections of danmu posts within the selected session(s) on separate tabs (Fig- ure 3(a5)).,""",,,,
The whole design of the primary timeline view follows a forest metaphor which will be introduced in Section 5.,,,,
The session summary view illustrates a storyline derived from the selected session(s) in a circle packing-based layout.,,,,
"5 Data Preprossessing and Analysis We obtained the danmu data and video clips from the bilibili1 , a major Chinese danmu sharing website.",,,,
"In this section, we describe the functions in the data preprocessing and analysis modules.",,,,
Feature Extraction.,,,,
We extract features from both video streams and danmu posts for conducting a clustering based video summarization analysis.,,,,
"In particular, we extract visual features from the key frames obtained from the raw video stream.",,,,
"First, we leverage the innate structures of a MPEG video and extract two types of frames, i.e.",,,,
"I-Frames and P-Frames, as keyframes based on FFmpeg (http://ffmpeg.org).",,,,
"Specifically, I-Frames are the fully-specified, uncompressed images in a video stream which usually indicate the switch of shots in the video.",,,,
"P-frames, in comparison, preserve only the data that are different from the preceding I-frame.",,,,
They capture the major changes in a shot.,,,,
"We extract features from each of I/Pframes based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) [Dalal and Triggs 2005] which was originally introduced for detecting objects in images and used for capturi,ng th,e changin,""g objects in case of video processing.,""",,,,
"For each frame, its HOG vector is formed by concatenating the components of normalized cell histograms over all block regions.",,,,
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is also used to balance the dimensions between HOG features and post features.,,,,
Employing the HOG feature enables us to filter out small local differences and emphasize on detecting major scene changes.,,,,
"The raw danmu data are crawled and stored in an XML file which contains eight attributes, i.e., each comment's physical and video time-stamps, position on screen, font size and color, content, visu,al ef,""fect, and"",""poster ID.,""",,,,
"For each danmu post, we extract the linguistic features categorized as follows: (1) Similarity, i.e., the number of danmu comments above a certain cosine similarity (0.4 and 0.8 respectively) with t,he gi,ven post.,"",""",,,,
(2) Sentiment.,,,,
"(3) The topic of danmu text, including actor, background music, review, character voice, danmu, graphics, producer, review, scene, title, movie, socializing, etc.",,,,
"(4) Communication function of danmu text, including emphasis, thought, observation, feeling, and need.",,,,
"(5) Use of \x0csymbols, including word, punctuation, number, letter, Emoji, and pointer.",,,,
"(6) Language pattern, including normal, repeat, rephrase, and reference (replying to a previous danmu).",,,,
This process yields a total of 32 textual features for each danmu message.,,,,
"To make a balance, we apply principle component analysis to reduce dimensions of HOG features so that the latter analysis can be fairly performed.",,,,
Meta-frame Construction and Analysis.,,,,
"With the above two types of features, we conduct further analysis at different levels.",,,,
"The lowest level is called meta-frame, i.e., assigning to each I/Pframe the danmu messages that occur within the time interval between its preceding and succeeding frames, if any.",,,,
"A meta-frame inherits the visual descriptor of its image component, and aggregates over the textual features of all the associated danmu comments to derive a set of collective textual attributes.",,,,
These together forms the feature vector of the meta-frame.,,,,
"The visual attributes of each meta-frame describe its content, while the textual part reflects the context derived from audience??reaction.",,,,
Session Analysis and Preview Assembly.,,,,
We define the video segment between two adjacent I-frames as a video coding session.,,,,
"In other words, a session consists of an I-frame that indicates the start of a new shot followed by a sequence of P-frames that signal the motions and changes of elements in the shot [Richardson 201,""1].,"",,",,,,
"For each session, we compute the total volume of damnu and the aggregated sentiment within its time window and generate its animated GIF preview using FFmpeg command.",,,,
We appoint the I-frame (or the first succeeding P-frame if the I-frame is too dark) of every session as its representative frame.,,,,
"Similar to meta-frame, we compose a hybrid feature vector for each session.",,,,
It consists of the color palette of the entire session generated by FFmpeg command as well as the synoptic linguistic attributes drawn out of all related danmu posts in its time range.,,,,
We also add the session start time to the session descriptor.,,,,
Scene Cluster Construction and Analysis.,,,,
"From video compression point of view, a session roughly corresponds to a shot in the video stream.",,,,
"It often takes multiple successive shots, likely from different angles, locations, or views, to make a scene.",,,,
"Therefore, we group shots into scene clusters based on their temporal adjacency, the similarity in the color tone, and congruence of audience's feedback in terms of both content and emotion.",,,,
"For each cluster, we again calculate the density of danmu commentary appearing in its time window as an indicator of the evocativeness of the scene.",,,,
"6 VideoForest Interface In this section, we describe the technical details for implementing the design of the aforementioned two views: the primary timeline view and the session summary view (i.e.,,story,""twig).,"",",,,,
"6.1 Primary Timeline View This view consists of three parts, i.e., scene forest, video timeline ground, and commentary root system.",,,,
"To produce the scene forest and the commentary root system, both the session-level frames extracted from the video and the danmu posts are first clustered into groups More specifically, the frames a,re cl,ustered b,""ased on their temporal adjacency, graphical features, and textual features extracted from danmu data (Section 4.4).,""",,,,
Each session cluster is visualized as a scene tree grown on top of the video timeline ground.,,,,
The danmu comments are clustered based on their content similarity.,,,,
Posts with the same messages are merged with the font size denoting the frequency of occurrence.,,,,
We produce a scene tree for each session cluster based on a series of calculations.,,,,
The representative images of sessions in the clus- ter are displayed as circular leaves and packed in a radial layout to form an umbrella-shaped canopy anchored at the top of the scene tree.,,,,
"Each tree is planted into the timeline ground at the middle time point of its associated video session sequence, with its height directly proportional to the number of danmu messages posted within i,ts co,rrespondi,""ng time window.,""",,,,
The heights of the trees are further adjusted to remove overlaps based on force-directed algorithm.,,,,
"In commentary root system, the aggregated danmu posts are laid out as a temporal tag cloud in a direction opposite to the scene forest by following a similar procedure.",,,,
"Each tag is placed at the video time point as appointed by its poster, and the height is adjusted to avoid overlap.",,,,
Note that the bounding box of a danmu tag is a rectangle instead of a half circle as that of the canopy of a scene tree.,,,,
6.2 Session Summary View Figure 4: (a) Mega-frame aggregation with each cluster labeled sequentially; the outliers are excluded.,,,,
(b) The construction of triangular complex.,,,,
"In this complex, the node 3 and 6 have 5 degrees, which is higher than others.",,,,
Hence the cluster 3 and 6 will be the anchors and the others are non-anchors.,,,,
The mega-frame feature vectors constructed in the analysis module are projected onto R by PCA with their timestamps being mapped to the x-axis (Figure 4).,,,,
"In other words, mega-frames are transformed into two-dimensional data points called chron-units in R2 (the first dimension of each data point is the first component of its PCA while second dimension,is i,ts timest,""amp).,""",,,,
This process stresses the visual and textual relationships among the meta-frames without tampering with their chronological arrangement.,,,,
We cluster the normalized chron-units with each resulting cluster indexed by its chronological order in the sequence and weighted by its size (Figure 4(a)).,,,,
"Then, we choose the image of the meta-frame closest to the center of a cluster as its representative to offer a glimpse at the shot in the associated time range.",,,,
"Further, we want to compose a meaningful timeline that threads all the representative shots to create an overview of the video plot in the specified time windows.",,,,
"Rather than simply placing these shots in R2 , we propose a two-phase holistic layout method that is reminiscent of circle packing [Collins and Stephenson 2003] to display the video summarization re,sults,of user-,""selected video segments.,""",,,,
Circle image packing.,,,,
"We represent each of the output clusters from the previous step as a circle, with the radius logarithmically proportional to the cluster weight to avoid exceedingly large radii.",,,,
The circles are indexed according to the temporal order of the corresponding clusters (Figure 4(a)).,,,,
"In our circle packing algorithm, we divide all the circles into two categories, i.e., anchors and nonanchors whose positions are determined by the former.",,,,
We adopt the Delaunay triangulation to construct a complex with each node denoting a cluster(Figure 4(b)).,,,,
"Namely, each circle in our final packing corresponds to a node in the complex.",,,,
"Different from the conventional circle packing algorithms (e.g., [Collins and Stephenson 2003]), which directly converts the complex edges to the pattern of tangencies, we use the complex to determi,ne th,e anchors,""in our \x0cFigure 6: (a) The corresponding node-link graph (green node: vs , red node: ve ); (b) circular motion principle.,""",,,,
The blue path just crossed the node t anticlockwise.,,,,
"The next feasible nodes would be t1 , t2 and t3 .",,,,
"However, the motion in direction t ??t3 contradicts to the path smoothness.",,,,
"Hence, only t1 and t2 would be the choices.",,,,
"More specifically, ti is feasible if and only if ti and t are on the same circle and t ??ti agrees with the previous circular motion or ti and t are not on the same circle and t ??ti disagrees with,the p,revious c,""ircular motion; and (c) the circle image packing with a storyline.,""",,,,
circle image packing.,,,,
"In this way, we maintain the chronological relationship and gain the flexibility to determine individual circle size.",,,,
"On top of that, we minimize potential waste of space.",,,,
"In particular, we choose circles of which the corresponding node has higher degrees to be the anchors.",,,,
"In a complex, the internal nodes tend to have higher degrees than the external ones.",,,,
"Therefore, in our circle image packing, we place the non-anchor circles around the anchors.",,,,
We position the first anchor at the origin.,,,,
"Then, all the circles before the next anchor are sequentially positioned in the following manner (see Figure 5(a)).",,,,
"They surround the current anchor clockwise, only intersecting with it at a common external tangent.",,,,
The pattern of tangencies also applies to consecutive nonanchors.,,,,
"Once a new anchor gets activated, it will become the center around which the successive non-anchors go in the same manner mentioned before (see Figure 5(b)).",,,,
We further remove the overlaps (R5) among circles to produce the final result.,,,,
to illustrate the tangent relationships among circles.,,,,
"More specifically, all the common external tangent points are mapped to the graph nodes.",,,,
"We refer to the common tangent point that connects to the first and second circles in the sequence as the start point (vs ), and the one between the last two circles as the end point (ve ).",,,,
"We assign a weight wi to each node vi , which is determined by the time differences between two clusters represented by the circles intersecting at the corresponding common tangent point.",,,,
"For each pair of the adjacent tangent points on the same circle, we insert an edge between their corresponding nodes (see Figure 6).",,,,
"The distance between P a node vi to the origin vs is defined as: dist(vi ) = min( k6=i wk ), i.e., the sum of weight for all vk except vi in the path (vs ??.",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
??vk ??.,,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
??vi ).,,,,
"We then convert the storyline construction on the circle image packing to a minimum-weight path finding the problem on the node-link graph, which can be efficiently solved by dynamic programming (as,desc,ribe in A,""lgorithm 1).,""",,,,
We also introduce the circular motion principle for each node (see Figure 6(c) for more details) to preserve the smoothness of the path.,,,,
"The circular motion for each node is flagged as follows: +1 for clockwise, ?? for counterclockwise, and 0 for either.",,,,
We also define the preceding node for each node vi as the one precedes it in the path (vs ??.,,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
??vi ).,,,,
"7 Evaluation Since VideoForest is the first of its kind that leverages danmu commentary for video summarization, there is a lack of baseline systems for a comparative study.",,,,
"Therefore, we evaluate our system via a case study and an informal focus group session with thirteen experts.",,,,
This section describes the evaluation methods and results which showcase the power of our system.,,,,
"7.1 Figure 5: (a) Circles are placed by the anchor, circle 3; (b) a new anchor, circle 6, gets activated.",,,,
Storyline threading.,,,,
We draw a smooth and spatially compact narrative thread to connect circle-circle intersecting points in a chronological order.,,,,
It forms a video summary within the user-selected time windows R2 (Figure 5).,,,,
Users can follow the storyline to view the representative shots in associated circles and browse related danmu cloud in the pop-up tooltips at the threaded tangent points.,,,,
"To derive such a storyline, we construct a weighted node-link graph Case Study This case study focus on understanding the video content and style.",,,,
"Here, we choose a Chinese movie ?쏶ilent Separation]",,,,
"[ as an example, given the fact people often compare it with another popular but hated movie ?쏷iny Times]",,,,
[ which we have watched before.,,,,
"Both movies are poorly rated by the viewers, and thus we are interested to know the similarity between them.",,,,
We imported an audience's cut version of the ?쏶ilent Separation??movie into VideoForest system.,,,,
The video is 205 seconds long and comes with 2052 danmu comments.,,,,
We obtained 61 I-frames and 1804 P-frames from the \x0c(2014).,,,,
"After the demonstration, we conducted a semi-structured interview with the participants followed by an open discussion.",,,,

We immediately noticed that the director likes to use close-up shots by skimming through the scene forest Figure.,,,,
7(1).,,,,
We recognized several familiar faces and realized that the movie employed almost the same cast as ?쏷iny Times],,,,
[.,,,,
"In addition, we found that many of the shots were in some kind of sepia tone like those old photos, which is consistent with the critic that the movie has a strong preference of earthy-yellow filter,""s.,"",,",,,,
From the danmu cloud (Figure.,,,,
"7(3)), we noticed that a comment ?쏻hat a disgrace??appears repeatedly throughout the video.",,,,
It seems that many viewers posted this message.,,,,
"We could guess that people were expressing their dislikes about the movie, but were puzzled by their consistent use of language.",,,,
"When turned back to the scene trees and went over each branch more closely, we realized that one key frame also occurred multiple times in summary.",,,,
After looking at the preview shown on the tool tip (Figure.,,,,
"7(2)), we found that it was a shot from the movie in which the line of the leading actress was ?쏻hat a disgrace!??This finding connected the different scenes into a coherent story and the commentar,y sta,rted to m,""ake sense.,""",,,,
We selected the video segments before all the instances of the ?쐂isgrace??shot.,,,,
The resulting session summary (Figure.,,,,
"7(4, 5)) basically revealed the major criticism of ?쏶ilent Separation]",,,,
"[: PowerPoint(PPT)-style narrative, nonsense conversations, and boring cast, according to user reviews on douban2 , a dedicated movie review website in China.",,,,
"7.2 User Observation To evaluate the design of our system and its potential usage, we organized a demonstration with thirteen expert guests from related areas.",,,,
"Four of them came from one of the leading animation companies in China, including a chief executive, a project manager, a marketing manager, and a technical director.",,,,
"The other participants were university faculties and students with different backgrounds: machine learning and data mining (one faculty and three graduate students), data visualization (one faculty,,expe,rienced i,""n video visualization), computer vision (one faculty, specialized in video processing), and new media art (two graduate students).,""",,,,
We started with an introduction of basic concepts related to danmu and an overview of the VideoForest system.,,,,

Participants from the animation company found the system particularly useful for several reasons.,,,,
"First, the variation in the size and height of the scene trees allow them to capture the pace and climax of the video.",,,,
"?쏻e can easily identify the most eye-catching and evocative parts of the video,??as the project manager of the animation company said.",,,,
"Second, VideoForest can help with sentiment analysis, discovering characters or plots that viewers liked or disliked based on their reactions.",,,,

"The proposed visualization design employs a forest metaphor, in which an overall summary of different sessions in a video is illustrated as scene trees grown on a video timeline ground, with the roo,ts de,picting t,""he corresponding danmu messages.,""",,,,

The results demonstrate the power and potential of our system.,,,,
Note that scalability to accommodate longer video streams is the most commonly mentioned issue among the experts.,,,,
"We believe it can be addressed using hierarchical aggregation of the video streams, as part of our future work.",,,,
"In addition, we will employ more advanced video analysis techniques to refine the summary quality and will deploy our system on video sharing websites to serve ordinary users.",,,,
"Some of the most exciting work taking place in The New York Times building is being done on the 28th floor, in the paper's Research and Development Lab.",,,,
"The group serves essentially as a skunkworks project for a news institution that stands to benefit, financially and otherwise, from creative thinking; as Michael Zimbalist, the Times??vice president,of R,""&D, puts"",""it, the team is ?쐇nvestigating the ideas at the edges of today and thinking about how they?셱e going to impact business decisions tomorrow.??(For more on the group's doings, check out the series of videos that we shot there a couple of years ago.),""",,,,
"Much of the R&D Lab's work, up to now, has been focused on platforms: tablets, TVs, screens, clouds.",,,,
"But the group is also thinking beyond gadgetry to two big ideas that are also a preoccupation of the news industry as a whole: the social sharing of news on the one hand, and the real-time processin,g of,data on t,""he other.,""",,,,

"Such controversy occurs over the gun control, abortion, nuclear power, religion, the location of an airport, and the influence of a movie.",,,,
"By understanding how controversy develops within the court of public opinion, we can gain many new insights into how a controversy arises and evolves, learn more about various roles of different cit,izens,in polic,""y making, identify those factors which customers care most about in their decision making, and analyze how cultural or demographic differences affect people's views.,""",,,,

"The studies mostly examined controversy based on ratings of items, such as movies and restaurants, and allowed users to identify and address complaints.",,,,
"For instance, Amendola et al. [3] quantified polarized and uniform rating distributions to identify controversy over a movie.",,,,
"However, this research only depends on quantitative analysis of ratings to judge whether controversy occurs, and may require reading all the reviews one-by-one to summarize the causes of a controver,""sy.,"",,",,,,
This would be very time-consuming and prone to ignoring some potentially important aspects.,,,,
"In order to overcome these limitations, we employ both ratings and text of reviews to explore when and why a controversy occurs from the aspect level.",,,,
This can help marketers and customers better understand controversial aspects of an item in large-scale reviews.,,,,
"Rating analysis identifies when a controversy may occur, and text analysis further verifies whether a controversy really exists and extracts what the controversy resulted from.",,,,
"Instead of looking at review-level sentiment divergences [35], we analyze aspect-level sentiment divergences to identify the causes of a controversy with a greater degree of granularity.",,,,
"When divergence occurs in some aspects, i.e., some reviews have a positive attitude to these aspects, and others have a negative attitude, it is clear that people have divergent views on the item an,d the,se aspect,""s are controversial aspects, which result in a controversy.,""",,,,
"Since the controversy of an item may change over time, we also need to characterize how the controversy evolves over time and when a controversy occurs.",,,,
"In this paper, we propose a novel visual analytics system, integrating quantitative and qualitative analysis methods to explore a controversy over time in web reviews in text and ratings in various,domai,""ns (e.g.,"",""restaurants, home goods, and cultural products).,""",,,,
Our system is able to highlight two major factors: when ??the timeevolving controversy trend and why ??the sentiment divergences of aspects.,,,,
We first apply quantitative analysis to the ratings of reviews to characterize the controversy evolution over time.,,,,
"Then, we propose a new method based on hierarchical clustering to accurately extract aspects from the text of reviews during the time period when the controversy occurs.",,,,
"After that, sentiment analysis is performed to compute the overall sentiments of the extracted aspects.",,,,
"Finally, we design a visual analytics system to intuitively represent the analysis results and support comparison of sentiment divergences of aspects effectively.",,,,
"The sentiment divergence of an aspect is visually encoded by a divergence glyph, which integrates the sentiment, the topic, and the rating distribution.",,,,
"Together with other visualization components, our system supports interactively identifying controversial aspects and understanding the controversy behind the reviews effectively.",,,,
Our method offers three main contributions as follows: ??We present a framework leveraging rating and text analysis to explore when and why a controversy occurs in reviews.,,,,
??We propose a new aspect-extraction method based on sense embeddings and hierarchical clustering to identify the causes of a controversy based on the aspect-level sentiment divergence.,,,,
??We introduce a visual analytics system based on well-designed visualization components and intuitive interactions for supporting interactive exploration of a controversy.,,,,
Our system is demonstrated in three case studies from different domains to show insights gained from controversial aspects of items.,,,,
"2 R ELATED W ORK In this section, we review related works from two perspectives: controversy quantification and controversy visualization.",,,,
"2.1 Controversy Quantification The issue of controversy in social media and online news has been widely studied, and many methods to quantify controversies have been proposed.",,,,
Most of them are based on network construction and social structure analysis.,,,,
Adamic et al. [1] constructed a citation network and measured the degree of interaction between liberal and conservative blogs during the U.S. Presidential Election.,,,,
Conover et al. [12] established retweet and mention networks and performed community detection using tweets during the U.S. congressional midterm elections.,,,,
Akoglu et al. [2] constructed signed bipartite networks based on online forum data to represent opinions of individuals and quantified political polarity by the Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm.,,,,
Garimella et al. [15] developed a random-walk-based measure on the retweet network to quantify the controversiality of a topic.,,,,
"Beyond a single topic, they can also compare multiple topics in any domain.",,,,
"These works could quantify the controversy over one single event such as the U.S. Presidential Election, and one topic with specific hashtags on Twitter.",,,,
"They focused on whether the event or topic was controversial and how controversial it was, but generally failed to explore the controversy from the aspect level.",,,,
"Beyond network-based controversy quantification, there are also other methods to quantify controversies.",,,,
"Livne et al. [22] applied Language Models to model the data on Twitter by the candidates during the U.S. midterm elections, and used the Kullback-Leibler divergence to analyze differences between De,mocra,""ts, Repub"",""licans and Tea Party candidates.,""",,,,
Yasseri et al. [41] quantified the controversy of an article based on its editorial history by summing the weights of all mutually reverting editor pairs in Wikipedia.,,,,
Brigadir et al. [7] studied language patterns in social and political contexts based on Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs).,,,,
They considered changes over time and between communities with differing views.,,,,
"Amendola et al. [3] studied controversy in movie ratings in the Internet Movie database (IMDb) with two statistical indexes, dubbed hard and soft controversy, which quantified polarized and uniform,ratin,g distrib,""utions, respectively.,""",,,,
They found that more recent movies were more controversial than older ones.,,,,
We extend their statistical indexes to time-dependent indexes to characterize the controversy evolution over time based on the rating distributions.,,,,
"Besides the ratings of reviews, we also analyze the text of reviews by aspect extraction and sentiment analysis to explain the causes of the controversy from the aspect level.",,,,
"2.2 Controversy Visualization Many simple methods have been used to visualize the quantified degree of a controversy, such as bar charts [8], line charts [3], scatter plots [19], and box plots [24].,"","",,",,,,
They mostly focus on the properties of a controversy.,,,,
Constructed static networks are also displayed by node-link diagrams [15] and adjacency matric [2] in many controversy quantification papers.,,,,
There are a few visualization systems for controversy analysis.,,,,
Brandes et al. [6] proposed a system based on a node-link diagram to depict the who revises whom-network to study controversy in encyclopedias.,,,,
Yasseri et al. [41] applied the searchCrystal toolset to provide aspects of the overlap structure in multiple languages in Wikipedia to visualize highly contested pages.,,,,
Cao et al. [9] grouped users based on their sentiment trends and designed a representation method based on DNA helices to visualize sentiment divergences between two groups.,,,,
Frequent keywords are also presented to explore the reasons of the sentiment divergence.,,,,
"Our system focuses on controversy in web reviews via aspect-level sentiment divergences, which are visually encoded by a divergence glyph.",,,,
"Similar to our aspect-level sentiment divergence visualization, there are several studies on sentiment analysis of reviews.",,,,
Oelke et al. [29] interactively analyzed comments and ratings to determine the sentiments expressed by customers.,,,,
Shi et al. [31] proposed a data model with multiple facets including topics and sentiments \x0cand designed a hybrid visualization to facilitate users understanding of text corpora.,,,,
"Since a user may express both positive and negative sentiments on one topic, Wu et al. [37] studied uncertainty information in opinion extraction, combination, and visualization.",,,,
Duan et al. [14] proposed a generic sentiment tuple to build a visual sentiment analysis system from aspects.,,,,
"However, they did not fully consider the relationships between controversy and sentiment divergences.",,,,
We propose a new aspect-extraction method and we analyze controversy via aspect-level sentiment divergences.,,,,
Figure 2: System overview.,,,,
"Data analysis module first quantifies a controversy via the ratings, extracts aspects from review text, and estimates the sentiment toward aspects.",,,,
"Visual design module shows the controversy index evolution over time, and designs three linked views to analyze the cause of a controversy.",,,,
3 OVERVIEW We first formulate tasks for our system to explore controversy over time in web reviews.,,,,
"Considering the two major requirements of the system: when ??the time-evolving controversy trend and why ??the sentiment divergences of aspects, we propose four tasks (T): T1: Characterize the time-,evolv,ing contr,""oversy trend.,""",,,,
"Since controversy in web reviews evolves over time, we need to characterize the time-evolving controversy trend.",,,,
This trend enables users to quickly identify whether an item is controversial and when a controversy occurs.,,,,
This is a fundamental task in our system.,,,,
T2: Extract aspects of reviews for theme summary.,,,,
We aim to summarize the causes of controversy in terms of aspects.,,,,
"Since there may be hundreds of reviews, it would be time-consuming to read all reviews during controversy analysis.",,,,
"Aspects are usually considered as themes, and reviews may contain different aspects.",,,,
"For a product, people talk about not only general aspects, such as quality and price of a pair of headphones, but also particular aspects, such as suitable situations for using a pair of headphones.,"","",,",,,,
"Thus, this method would be an effective means to extract aspects automatically and summarize the themes of reviews.",,,,
T3: Understand controversy from aspect-level sentiment divergences.,,,,
Reviews may involve many aspects and the sentiments may vary with the aspects.,,,,
"If there are roughly half positive and half negative reviews for an aspect, this aspect can be considered to be one cause of a controversy.",,,,
"Thus, we need to identify all the aspects having sentiment divergence to fully understand a controversy.",,,,
T4: Relate aspects to the original reviews.,,,,
It is essential for users to retrieve and analyze the original reviews at any stage of the previous tasks.,,,,
An aspect can guide users to quickly identify related reviews and further understand the aspects by integrating their domain knowledge.,,,,
"Moreover, as it is generally difficult for aspect-level sentiment analysis to reach human-level accuracy, this task can also verify the analysis results of previous tasks.",,,,
These tasks frame the general requirements of our system.,,,,
"We need to determine when a controversy occurs based on the timeevolving controversy trend, and analyze the causes of the controversy based on the aspect-level sentiment divergence and the original,revie,""ws.,"",",,,,
Fig.,,,,
2 shows the pipeline of our system.,,,,
"The input of the system is the reviews of an item, consisting of both review text and ratings.",,,,
It has two major modules: data analysis and visual design.,,,,
The data analysis module first computes the time-evolving controversy trend with quantitative analysis of the ratings of an item.,,,,
The aspects of the reviews within a selected time period are extracted based on sense embedding and hierarchical clustering.,,,,
The Sentiments of these aspects are estimated to explore the causes of the controversy.,,,,
The visual design module first shows the time-evolving controversy trend with the line chart and the bar chart.,,,,
"The aspect-level sentiments are presented in three linked views, namely, the aspect bubble view, the sentiment pie view, and the partition tree view.",,,,
The aspect bubble view represents the sentiment distribution of aspects.,,,,
The sentiment pie view helps users understand the detailed information of aspects.,,,,
The partition tree view shows the hierarchical structure of aspects.,,,,
The well-designed system incorporates intuitive interactions to support comparison of sentiment divergences of aspects and identification of the causes of a controversy effectively.,,,,
"4 DATA A NALYSIS The data analysis of reviews consists of three steps presented in the following sub-sections: controversy quantification, aspect extraction, and sentiment estimation.",,,,
4.1 Controversy Quantification Controversy quantification is a fundamental step to identify whether an item is controversial and when the controversy occurs.,,,,
"Since the review dataset contains both ratings and text, it is different from the data on Twitter.",,,,
Previous controversy quantification methods based on network structure analysis or with two explicit communities are not suitable for web reviews.,,,,
"Moreover, when controversy does not occur in reviews, it is time-consuming and ineffective to analyze controversy with text mining or other complicated methods.",,,,
"Thus, we first apply quantitative analysis to the ratings of reviews.",,,,
"Ammendola et al. [3] considered a situation with many very-high ratings and many very-low ratings to be a hard controversy, and a situation with most ratings across a broad spectrum as a soft contro,versy,"".,"",",,,,
They proposed two indexes H and S as normalized measures of hard and soft controversies.,,,,
"The estimator similar to H was advocated by previous works [43], while the estimator of S was first introduced and achieved a good performance in controversy quantification.",,,,
"Since controversy may change over time, we extend the two indexes H and S in the time window with the width ?냪, representing months, years, etc.",,,,
"Low H, high S, and high H characterize the three rating distributions: peaked, flat, and polarized, respectively.",,,,
"Thus, in the case of high S and low H, soft controversy tends to occur, and in the case of high H and low S, hard controversy tends to occur.",,,,
"The hard controversy index Hi with the time window ti is defined as a normalized standard deviation: \x0cwhere M is the number of the rating level, such as the five-level rating from 1 to 5.",,,,
"In pm = vm /N, vm is the number of votes of the rating rm = m, and N is the total number of votes during the time window ti .",,,,
"r? = ?몀 pm rm is the average rating, and c2H is the highest possible variance.",,,,
cH = (M ??1)/2 is obtained if half the ratings are 1 and half are M (a completely polarized distribution).,,,,
"The higher the value of Hi is, the more polarized the rating distribution is.",,,,
"The soft controversy index Si with the time window ti is defined as follows: which is a square root of a ? 2 statics relative to the flat distribution p with pm = 1/M, normalized with cS = 1 ??1/M.,"","",,",,,,
"Si vanishes if all votes are given to a single rating m. The higher the value of Si is, the more even the rating distribution is.",,,,
"Since a small number of votes generally leads to decreased performances when calculating H and S, we extend the time window until the number of votes is above a threshold when there are too few vote,s in,the curre,""nt time window (a month in our implementation).,""",,,,
"If there are not enough reviews about an item, it is biased to judge whether it is controversial from available reviews.",,,,
"4.2 Aspect Extraction Within the controversial time period, we need to extract aspects in reviews to analyze the causes of a controversy in a more understandable manner.",,,,
"Features are components and attributes of an item, and they are mentioned as opinion targets.",,,,
An aspect can be considered as a group of features.,,,,
"For example, features are terms like pizza and pie, and grouping them can obtain an aspect referring food.",,,,
"Aspect extraction is a hot topic in natural language processing [4, 33].",,,,
Chen et al. [10] proposed a clustering method to simultaneously identify features and group them into aspects based on their domainspecific similarities and merging constraints.,,,,
This clustering method has been proved to have a better performance than other methods.,,,,
"Our aspect-extraction method consists of three steps: feature extraction and representation, partition generation, and partition merging.",,,,
We first extract features and represent features via sense embeddings.,,,,
"The k-nearest-neighbor algorithm is employed to generate partitions, and these partitions are hierarchically merged to generate aspects.",,,,
"Compared to Chen et al. [10], our method employs an improved hierarchical clustering method that does not need the number of aspects and uses the similarity measure based on sense embeddings to bett,er gr,oup featu,""res with similar semantic meanings.,""",,,,
"4.2.1 Feature Extraction and Representation As features are generally the attributes and components that describe the characteristics of an item, we consider nouns and consecutive noun phrases as fe,ature,s based o,""n the Stanford Log-linear Part-OfSpeech Tagger.,""",,,,
"We filter out the stop words, which are mostly common but unimportant.",,,,
"The low frequency features are also filtered out, as the high frequency features are more likely the actual features of interest.",,,,
"Although features are different, their semantic meanings may be the same.",,,,
"It is desirable to cluster features with similar semantic meanings, so that the terms referring to the same aspect are put into one group.",,,,
The main question then is how to effectively capture the semantic meanings of features.,,,,
"Word embeddings [25, 26] have been proposed to generate dense, short and semantically-meaningful vectors to capture both syntactic and semantic information.",,,,
"They have been successfully applied to different natural language processing tasks including semantic similarity measurements [5, 11].",,,,
"However, word embeddings inherit an important limitation in that they are unable to model distinct meanings of a word, despite the fact that a single word may have different parts of speech and each,may,have a di,""fferent meaning or sense.,""",,,,
"For example, duck refers to the concept of a waterfowl, or the action of crouching.",,,,
"Therefore, we employ sense embeddings to represent multiple word senses per word [17,34,38].",,,,
"Sense embeddings use different senses to represent different word types, and in particular, each sense is associated with a sense specific embedding.",,,,
"As it is more accurate to capture the semantic meanings of words by using the related text corpus [39], we prepare the field-related text corpus and label the corpus with the Stanford Log-linear Par,tOf-S,peech Tag,""ger.,""",,,,
Then we train our sense embeddings by using the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model [26].,,,,
"After training, word senses are represented by sense embeddings, and each feature corresponds to a vector in the low dimensional space, typically 50500.",,,,
"Compared to the domain-specific similarities [10], we use sense embeddings instead of word embeddings to provide better semantic meanings of features.",,,,
"4.2.2 Partition Generation In order to group features to aspects, we first apply the k-nearestneighbor algorithm to generate partitions, and then use a clustering method to hierarchically merge part,ition,""s.,"",",,,,
The similarity between features is based on sense embeddings.,,,,
"There are many similarity metrics for two vectors, such as the Euclidean distance, the Jaccard similarity, and the cosine similarity.",,,,
The most widely used similarity metric in word embeddings is the cosine similarity [20].,,,,
"Therefore, we use the cosine similarity to measure the similarity between features.",,,,
"The higher the value of the cosine is, the more similar the two features are.",,,,
"With the cosine similarity between features, each feature first finds its k most similar neighbors with the similarity above the userspecified threshold.",,,,
"For each neighbor feature in its k most similar features, we add the neighbor feature to the partition that the feature belongs to.",,,,
"In our experiments, we find that the meanings of features are very different when their similarities are less than 0.5.",,,,
"Hence, we set the similarity threshold to 0.5.",,,,
"In this case, when k is 2, the generated partition would contain almost all features.",,,,
"Thus, we set k to 1 to group the most similar features into a partition, and the number of partitions is large enough to separate different aspects.",,,,
"4.2.3 Partition Merging After all features are grouped into partitions, we need to hierarchically cluster partitions into aspects.",,,,
"We first describe the similarity measurement between partitions, i.e., groups of features, as follows: where simavg (Pl , Pm ) is the average similarity of features between partitions Pl and Pm , r(,Pl ),is the mo,""st important feature measured by the TF-IDF value as the representative feature in partition Pl , and simrep (Pl , Pm ) is the similarity between the representative features of the two partitions.,""",,,,
"sim(Pl , Pm ) is the similarity between two partitions, which is the minimum value between the averaged similarity of features and the similarity of two representative features in two partitions.",,,,
Two partitions are considered as similar when both the average similarity and representative similarity are high.,,,,
"We hierarchically merge partitions until the minimum similarity between partitions is above the threshold, 0.3 based on our experiment.",,,,
4.3 Sentiment Estimation We need to estimate the sentiments of aspects to understand a controversy from sentiment divergences of aspects.,,,,
"An aspect is a group of features, and a feature can be represented by a group of sentences which contain the feature.",,,,
"Thus, the sentiment of an aspect can be estimated by the sentiments of sentences, which contain at least one feature in the aspect.",,,,
"There are many sentiment analysis techniques to identify whether a sentence is positive or negative, and the accuracies of these methods are between 80% and 85% [32].",,,,
We leverage Apache OpenNLP Document Categorizer to classify sentences into pre-defined categories.,,,,
"To improve the accuracy of sentiment classification, we prepare the corpus-related training datasets to train the Document Categorizer model.",,,,
We define the sentiment of an aspect as the ratio of the number of positive sentences to the number of all sentence in the aspect.,,,,
"When the sentiment approaches 1 or 0, the aspect tends to be positive or negative.",,,,
"When the sentiment is around 0.5, the aspect tends to be controversial.",,,,
"5 V ISUAL D ESIGN In order to visually explore a controversy in reviews, we design a visual analytics system to enable users to gain insights into when and why a controversy occurs.",,,,
"In response to the aforementioned tasks, we derive four design requirements to guide our design process: R1: Controversy evolution characterization.",,,,
"The system should support users well in understanding the time-evolving controversy trend, which is a fundamental requirement of our system.",,,,
Users can identify whether the item is controversial and when the controversy occurs.,,,,
R2: Aspect presentation.,,,,
The system should provide a good overview of aspects and their sentiments for summarization.,,,,
It should also make it easy to identify which aspects are mainly positive or negative and the main content of each aspect.,,,,
The original reviews of the aspect should be accessible on demand.,,,,
R3: Sentiment divergence visualization.,,,,
The system should enable users to visually compare the sentiments of different aspects and highlight controversial aspects with sentiment divergences.,,,,
This is vital for users to understand the causes of a controversy.,,,,
R4: Usability.,,,,
"Since the system is designed to be used by marketers and customers without much explanation and training, it should be easy to learn and use.",,,,
We use familiar representation methods with intuitive interactions to improve the usefulness of our system.,,,,
These design requirements are reflected in the visual design of our system.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
"1 shows the overview of our system with eight views, which are connected by brushing and linking to allow for flexibly exploring controversy from the aspect level.",,,,
"In the following subsections, we discuss our system according to the design requirements.",,,,
The line chart and bar chart present an overview of a controversy evolution over time (R1).,,,,
"The aspect bubble view, the partition tree view, and the aspect burst view provide three complementary visual representations of aspects (R2).",,,,
The sentiment pie view displays sentiment divergences of aspects (R3).,,,,
We favor usability over interactions (R4).,,,,
"5.1 Controversy Evolution Characterization A controversy is described by two time-dependent indexes, H and S, and we employ the widely used line chart to present the controversy evolution informatio,""n.,"",,",,,,
The horizontal time axis is scaled automatically to the range of time that reviews were posted.,,,,
"The time-evolving trends of H and S are shown in the gray and chocolate colored lines, respectively.",,,,
The line chart can be used to select the time period when a controversy occurs.,,,,
"Although H and S reveal the controversy evolution over time, the original rating distribution should also be provided to verify the controversy assumption.",,,,
The bars are encoded by the colors from red to green corresponding to the ratings from low to high.,,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"1(f), H is higher than S and approaches 0.8 by the end of 2014.",,,,
"This indicates that a hard controversy (polarization) possibly occurred, which can be further verified by the rating distribution in Fig.",,,,
1(c).,,,,
"While in September 2015, S is a little higher than H and approaches to 0.8.",,,,
This indicates that a soft controversy (even voting) possibly occurred.,,,,
"5.2 Aspect Presentation We extract aspects from the reviews within the user selected time period, and estimate the sentiments of aspects.",,,,
"These aspects with their sentiments are visualized in the aspect bubble view, the partition tree view, and the aspect burst view.",,,,
"The size in these three views is proportional to the number of sentences associated with the aspect or partition, as discussed in Section 4.3.",,,,
"The colors from red to green are used to encode the sentiment from negative to positive in these three views, as shown in the left part of Fig.",,,,
1,,,,
"In the aspect bubble view, a bubble represents an aspect.",,,,
"The sentiment from negative to positive is encoded by the horizontal position from left to right, as shown in Fig.",,,,
1(a).,,,,
"When two aspects have similar sentiments, they are arranged from the center to both sides to avoid overlap.",,,,
The aspect bubble view can be used to provide an overview of the aspect-level sentiment distribution.,,,,
"The partition tree view shows the process of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering from bottom to top, as shown in Fig.",,,,
1(e).,,,,
Each rectangle is a partition.,,,,
This view provides an overview of sentiments of multi-level aspects to analyze the sentiment differences of the partitions.,,,,
"Besides an overview of all aspects in the partition tree view, we also provide the aspect burst view to display the hierarchical structure of an aspect for detailed analysis, including sentiments an,d fea,tures of,""its child aspects.,""",,,,
"The aspect burst view is a radial tree, and two aspect bursts are shown in Fig.",,,,
1(h).,,,,
Traversing the tree from periphery to center follows a merging process of the root aspect.,,,,
The text label on each sector is the most frequent feature in the aspect.,,,,
The root aspect in the aspect burst view can be selected by clicking on a sector of interest.,,,,
"Once an aspect is selected, the aspect burst view displays the merging process of this aspect.",,,,
This view facilitates users examining the sentiments of the child aspects.,,,,
5.3 Sentiment Divergence Visualization The aspect-level sentiment divergence should be visually presented to identify the causes of a controversy within the user selected time period.,,,,
This also further verifies whether the controversy actually occurs within this time period.,,,,
We design a divergence glyph to support a visual comparison between aspects in the sentiment pie view.,,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"1(d), the divergence glyph encodes the sentiment, topic, and rating distribution of an aspect in an unified design, and consists of two parts: the inner pie diagram and the outer ring.",,,,
The traditional pie diagram expresses the quality of each section through the size of the central angle or area.,,,,
"For multiple pie charts, however, slice sizes are very difficult to compare side-by-side.",,,,
"Here, the inner pie diagram is vertically split into two parts, the width of which is proportional to the number of the sentences with negative (orange) and positive (green) sentiments in an aspect.,"","",,",,,,
The most important features of the aspect are displayed inside the pie diagram.,,,,
The font size is proportional to the importance value of the feature.,,,,
"A richer word cloud is provided in the word cloud view, as shown in Fig.",,,,
"1(b), since the space in the pie diagram is limited to show all important features.",,,,
"The outer ring around the pie diagram is a circular surrounding bar chart, which summarizes the rating distribution of the aspect.",,,,
"As mentioned in Section 4.3, an aspect is associated with sentences.",,,,
"Thus, the rating distribution of an aspect can be considered as the rating distribution of the reviews that contain the sentence.",,,,
"The ring is colored from red to green to indicate the rating from low to high, and the arc length of each sector is proportional to the number of reviews in this rating.",,,,
We arrange the sectors of the outer ring from \x0cFigure 3: Controversy analysis for Interstellar on IMDb.,,,,
"Both H and S have high values, and H is higher than S just after the movie is released, and then H decreases over time.",,,,
"The aspect bursts of the cooper and matt aspect are represented in (a) and (b), respectively.",,,,
"-90 degrees to 270 degrees, which facilitates a comparison between the sentiment distribution and the rating distribution.",,,,
"Similar to the aspect bubble view, all divergence glyphs are arranged from left to right according to their sentiments in the sentiment pie view.",,,,
"If an overlap or collision occurs, the glyph searches for a suitable position based on the Archimedean spiral.",,,,
The sentiment pie view facilitates the visual summarization and comparison of sentiment divergences of aspects.,,,,
5.4 Interaction Our visualization system supports well-designed interactions to explore a controversy effectively.,,,,
Selecting a time period.,,,,
"Since a controversy may change over time, users can select an interested time period via brushing in the line chart with H and S for guidance.",,,,
"After selecting a time period, the rating distribution and aspects are both updated based on the reviews within the time period.",,,,
Selecting aspects.,,,,
"As there may be many aspects in large-scale reviews, it is desirable to select aspects of interest for detailed analysis to reduce visual clutter.",,,,
"Users can select aspects in the aspect bubble view together with the sentiments of multi-level aspects in the partition tree view, and the selected aspects are stroked with dark gray and their detai,led i,nformatio,""n is shown in the sentiment pie view.,""",,,,
Selecting an aspect.,,,,
"When users click a divergence glyph in the sentiment pie view, the divergence glyph is stroked with black, its aspect is stroked with blue in the aspect bubble view, and its aspect burst view is pop,ped o,ut to sho,""w the detailed sentiment and hierarchical structure of the selected aspect.,""",,,,
The word cloud view is also updated to present more features of the aspect.,,,,
"When users select the left/right part of the pie diagram, the corresponding part is stroked with black and reviews are listed in the text view.",,,,
Selecting a feature.,,,,
"Since word clouds can guide users to quickly understand reviews, the system supports feature exploration.",,,,
"When users select an interested feature in the sentiment pie view or the word cloud view, it is colored blue, and the sentences are sorted by its frequency in the text view.",,,,
Labeling an aspect.,,,,
"During exploration, the aspects can be labeled as controversial with pink or noncontroversial with blue in the aspect bubble view, as shown in Fig.",,,,
1(a).,,,,
"The number of labeled aspects is visualized by the bar chart in the line chart, as shown in Fig.",,,,
1(f).,,,,
This enables users to find how many controversial aspects are in a given time period.,,,,
The aspects with the controversial label help users summarize their finds to the causes of the controversy.,,,,
"6 E VALUATION In this section, we first evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed aspect-extraction method.",,,,
"After that, we show the usefulness of our controversy analysis method based on three case studies in different domains.",,,,
"Finally, we present a user study to evaluate our system.",,,,
"6.1 Evaluation on Aspect Extraction Recently, Chen et al. [10] proposed a clustering method to identify product aspects from web reviews, and they released a dataset for the evaluation on aspect ext,racti,""on.,"",",,,,
"Since our method can also be used in the product domain, we use the same dataset to compare the effectiveness of our method with other methods.",,,,
Table 1 describes the dataset of two products on Amazon and one product on the online shop of a cell phone company.,,,,
"The training corpus of sense embeddings is Amazon Electronics data with 3,663,769 reviews.",,,,
Table 1: Data sets and gold standards.,,,,
"We compare our method against four approaches on aspect extraction, namely, MuReinf [33], L-EM [42], L-LDA [42], and CAFE [10].",,,,
MuReinf uses the mutual reinforcement association between features and opinion words to iteratively group them.,,,,
L-EM applies the Naive Bayesian-based EM algorithm to group synonym features into categories.,,,,
L-LDA is based on LDA to group features.,,,,
CAFE groups the features into clusters based on their domainspecific similarities and merging constraints.,,,,
"Since MuReinf, L-EM, L-LDA only focus on aspect extraction, features are extracted by CAFE.",,,,
Our method also uses CAFE to extract features.,,,,
"We evaluate the results via the widely used Rand Index [30], since it is considered as a standard measure of the similarity between clustering results.",,,,
"The Rand Index is simply 2(a + b)/(n 횞 (n ??1)), where n is the number of the objects, a is the number of the pairs that belong to the same cluster in both partitions, and b is the number of the pa,irs t,hat belon,""g to different clusters in both partitions.,""",,,,
The Rand Index lies between 0 and 1.,,,,
"When two partitions agree perfectly, the Rand Index is 1.",,,,
Table 2: Rand Index of aspect identification.,,,,
"Table 2 lists the Rand Index of different methods, and our method has the best performance on aspect identification.",,,,
"The improvement on aspect extraction may be mainly due to sense embeddings, which better capture the semantic meanings of features.",,,,
"In addition, our \x0cmethod does not require the number of aspects, as it automatically stops when the minimum similarity between partitions is large enough.",,,,
"Since aspect extraction is performed after the user selects a time period, the computational efficiency should be high enough to support interactive exploration.",,,,
"For instance, 731 features are extracted from the reviews of a pair of headphones, and the final number of aspects is 35 after the hierarchical clustering.",,,,
"The computational times are 550 ms and 6669 ms for the hierarchical clustering with and without the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm, i.e., partition generation, respectively.",,,,
"Thus, the efficiency of our method is acceptable for users to interactively explore a controversy.",,,,
"6.2 Case Studies We have applied our system to analyze the items in three domains as follows: movies, products, and restaurants.",,,,
6.2.1 Characterizing the time-evolving controversy trend We first describe how our system characterizes the time-evolving controversy trend.,,,,
"We leverage the 2616 reviews on IMDb for Interstellar, released in November 2014, as shown in Fig.",,,,
3,,,,
The sense embedding set is trained from the reviews of 193 movies randomly collected from IMDb.,,,,
The line chart shows two indexes from October 2014 to March 2016.,,,,
Both hard and soft controversy indexes are high and their ranges are from 0.6 to 0.8.,,,,
"H reaches its maximum value at 0.8, much higher than S, just after the movie is released.",,,,
H then decreases over time.,,,,
"According to the evolution of H, we can assume that the hard controversy possibly occurs just after the movie is released.",,,,
We first select this time period.,,,,
"The left rating distribution verifies our hypothesis that many reviewers give the lowest rating, and many other reviewers give the highest rating.",,,,
"Then, we select the recent time period.",,,,
H decreases and its range is between 0.6 and 0.7.,,,,
"The right rating distribution also indicates that the polarization is weakened, as the number of the highest rating is clearly larger than the number of the lowest rating.",,,,
"Previous research has found a similar result where movie audiences are more critical just after a movie is first screened and more likely to post extreme views [18, 21], and then the variance steadi,ly de,creases o,""ver time [43].,""",,,,
This demonstrates the usefulness of our system on characterizing the time-evolving controversy trend.,,,,
We further examine the causes of a controversy.,,,,
"In the left aspect bubble view, most bubbles, such as the story plot, oscars, and cooper aspects, are located near the middle line (the neural sentiment), which indicates that the sentiments of thes,e asp,ects may,""be divergent.,""",,,,
One main aspect is the story plot aspect with many comments.,,,,
Some comments are ?쐔he story is just incredibly absorbing and really satisfying?? while other comments are ?쐔he basis of the sentimental story does not sit well in the overall story??,,,,
We label this aspect as controversial.,,,,
While the right aspect bubble view indicates that many aspects have a large percentage of positive reviews.,,,,
The characters aspect is located near the middle line with many reviews.,,,,
"We can conclude that reviewers mention about the story plot more in the early period, while they talk more about the characters in the later period.",,,,
"The cooper aspect, nearing the middle line, is also controversial and its aspect burst is represented in Fig.",,,,
"3(a), where the matthew mcconaughey and the michael caine aspects have more positive reviews than the anne hathaway aspect.",,,,
The matt damon aspect in the right sentiment pie view is very noticeable as the aspect with the most negative sentiments in Fig.,,,,
"3(b), and this may be because Matt Damon plays a villain in Interstellar.",,,,
6.2.2 Figure 4: Controversy analysis for a pair of Bose headphones on Amazon.,,,,
"The aspect bursts of the music, time, and quality aspects are shown in (a), (b) and (c), respectively.",,,,
The child aspects of the padding aspect is presented in (d).,,,,
embedding set is trained from the Amazon Electronics data.,,,,
"In the line chart, both H and S basically remain stable over time, and this is a typical trend for a product.",,,,
"Thus, we select the whole time period.",,,,
The rating distribution shows that most reviewers give a high rating to the headphones.,,,,
"Moreover, all aspects are located in the right positive side in the aspect bubble view, and this agrees with the rating distribution.",,,,
Main aspects are displayed in the sentiment pie view.,,,,
"Reviewers are more interested in the headphones aspect, including sound, noise, and volume of a pair of headphones.",,,,
"The flight aspect with the features, train, trip, and asia, is about its usefulness when traveling, especially to a remote area.",,,,
The glasses aspect may be strange in the reviews of a pair of headphones.,,,,
"By selecting this aspect, the text view shows that there are many people who care about whether the headphone design is comfortable for people with glasses.",,,,
"Although all aspects tend to be positive, there are still some negative aspects, yellow and orange colored partitions, as shown in the partition tree view.",,,,
"We further explore sentiment divergences in three aspects, i.e., quality, time, and music.",,,,
"By clicking the quality aspect, its aspect burst in Fig.",,,,
4(c) shows that its child padding aspect is negative.,,,,
"When clicking the padding aspect, as can be seen clearly from its child aspects in Fig.",,,,
"4(d), the negative sentiment of the padding aspect is mostly due to the damage aspect.",,,,
The time aspect burst in Fig.,,,,
4(b) reveals the pressure issue when using the headphones for hours.,,,,
The music aspect burst in Fig.,,,,
4(a) indicates that people like to use these headphones to listen to the music with an ipod or a mp3 player.,,,,
"The reviewers also mention the gym aspect, colored yellow, showing that people often use the headphones at the gym to drown out the noise, but their effect needs to be improved.",,,,
We label these three aspects as controversial.,,,,
"Through this case study, we show the usefulness of our system on interpreting the sentiment divergences of aspects.",,,,
"Marketers can identify and address those aspects with problems from aspectlevel sentiment analysis, and improve negative and controversial aspects.",,,,
Customers can rank the aspects according to their personal preferences and choose the product that meets their preferences.,,,,
"Interpreting sentiment divergences of aspects In this case study, we demonstrate how our system can effectively interpret sentiment divergences of aspects.",,,,
The 567 reviews of a pair of Bose headphones on Amazon are shown in Fig.,,,,
4,,,,
"The sense 6.2.3 Detecting and interpreting controversy In this case study, we show how our system detects and interprets controversy through aspect-level sentiment divergence.",,,,
We analyze \x0cFigure 5: Controversy analysis for an Indian cuisine restaurant on Yelp.,,,,
"The rating distributions of two time periods, before 2014 and after 2014, are shown on the left and right of the line chart, respectively.",,,,
"The upper row of aspect bursts contains three aspect bursts before 2014, and the bottom row contains three aspect bursts after 2014. the 790 reviews of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Yelp, as shown,in F,""ig.,"",",,,,
5,,,,
"The sense embedding set is trained from the yelp academic dataset with 1,569,264 reviews.",,,,
"The line chart shows that S is higher than H before 2014, while S decreases from 0.7 to 0.6 after 2014, which indicates that the soft controversy has gradually been reduced.",,,,
"When we select two time periods, before 2014 and after 2014, the rating distributions are shown on the left and right of the line chart in Fig.",,,,
"5, respectively.",,,,
"There are many ratings of 4 stars before 2014, while there are few ratings of 4 stars after 2014.",,,,
How does this restaurant develop from a good restaurant to a great restaurant?,,,,
We further analyze the aspects and their sentiments generated from the reviews in the two time periods.,,,,
We select some common aspects with different sentiments in the two time periods and distinctive aspects in each time period in the sentiment pie view.,,,,
Their aspect bursts are provided in the last two rows in Fig.,,,,
5,,,,
"Generally, there are two cases that can raise the controversy index.",,,,
"One is that many aspects are controversial, and the other is that some aspects are positive and others are negative.",,,,
"Before 2014, the nann, decor, and place aspects tend to be positive, while the parking aspect has a large percentage of negative reviews and is located at the leftmost position in the aspect bubble,view.,"","",",,,,
"Its aspect burst is close to red and its word cloud consists of features, such as gunpoint, police cars, and renovations.",,,,
This means that people complained a great deal about the parking lot that may have needed major renovation.,,,,
"While after 2014, the parking aspect is located on the right of the middle line in the aspect bubble view, and its aspect burst is close to green.",,,,
"After reading related reviews in the text view, we can conclude that this restaurant received a new asphalt parking lot after 2014.",,,,
"In addition, the decor aspect only appears before 2014, so we can infer that this restaurant underwent a renovation before 2014.",,,,
"Similarly, the staff aspect is relatively negative before 2014, but the waiter aspect, similar to the staff aspect, tends to be positive after 2014.",,,,
"As can be seen from the staff aspect burst, the staff is associated with phones.",,,,
"The reason for the negative sentiment may be that people complained about the staff using phones, which was proven in the text view when clicking the word staff in the word cloud view.",,,,
"The waiter aspect burst includes two child aspects, vick and garry, which are waiters??names who have mostly positive reviews when checking related reviews.",,,,
The yelp aspect is located at the leftmost position in the aspect bubble view and it only appears after 2014.,,,,
"As shown in its word cloud, we can infer that Yelp coupons become popular, while customers are unhappy with the coupons.",,,,
"After reading related reviews, we find that when customers use the coupon, they are informed of all kinds of restrictions that are not stated on the coupons.",,,,
This should be improved.,,,,
"This example demonstrates that our system can effectively detect and interpret a controversy, and gain insights into controversial aspects.",,,,
"6.3 User Study We performed a user study to evaluate the usability of our system, especially the visual design, on controversy analysis in web reviews for customers and marketers.",,,,
This user study involves 30 participants (12 male and 8 female) aged 20 to 30 years from diverse majors (6 undergraduate and 14 graduate students).,,,,
Nine of them have some knowledge of visualization.,,,,
"In particular, they all have online shopping experience and 7 of them have selling experience.",,,,
6.3.1 Study Design The study consists of three sessions.,,,,
We started with a 5-minute introduction and demonstration of our system.,,,,
"We then provided two datasets, Yelp dataset with the reviews of an Indian and a Japanese cuisine restaurant, and Amazon dataset with the reviews of a pair of Bose headphones and an ipad.",,,,
We first allowed the participants \x0cto choose one dataset and then four tasks corresponding to design requirements that were given to the participants.,,,,
"For each item in the dataset, they were asked to browse the corresponding website about the item guided by these tasks for 5 minutes, then use our system guided by these tasks for 20 minutes, and fi,nally,fill in,""a questionnaire.,""",,,,
"An optional 10-minute interview session was conducted, where 10 participants expressed their opinions on the functionality of our system.",,,,
The study lasted about 1 hour.,,,,
"We propose four design requirements, controversy evolution characterization, aspect presentation, sentiment divergence visualization, and usability in Section 5.",,,,
"The four tasks that include combinations of these requirements are the following: (1) when a controversy occurs in reviews (R1), (2) what aspects are the causes of the controversy (R3), (3) the sent,iment,divergen,""ces of the aspects that one cares about when deciding where to eat or what to purchase (R2, R3), and (4) what aspects need to be improved or can be considered as the controversial marketing tactics to target the right market (R2, R3).,""",,,,
We recorded the task results of each participant and then asked them to fill in a questionnaire regarding the exploration experience.,,,,
"We organized the four design requirements into statement expressions in the questionnaire: (1) the system supports users well in understanding the time-evolving controversy trend (R1), (2) the syste,m pro,vides a g,""ood overview of the aspects and the sentiment of the aspects (R2), (3) The system enables users to identify why the sentiment divergences occur in aspects (R3), (4) The system is easy to learn and use (R4).,""",,,,
Participants are asked whether they agree with the statement expression.,,,,
We employed a Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) on all statements.,,,,
The results of the questionnaire are the participants??subjective ratings on the system interface.,,,,
"Although we asked the participants to solve tasks, we did not evaluate the participants??performance of these tasks.",,,,
"There is no clearly delineated definition of controversy, which in turn makes the task results difficult to evaluate.",,,,
We design these tasks to guide the participants to seriously explore the reviews with the system.,,,,
"However, participants are potentially biased toward positive answers that the authors wish to obtain.",,,,
We need to interpret the results cautiously and it is still valid to compare the ratings to each other.,,,,
"Moreover, the opinions of the optional interview session are very helpful to improve our system.",,,,
6.3.2 Study Results We now discuss the study results as summarized in Fig.,,,,
6,,,,
We also estimate the hard and soft controversy indexes of the user study.,,,,
"The average ratings for all design requirements are 5.8 or above, which indicates that our system meets the expectations of the participants.",,,,
"All soft controversy indexes remain almost stable, while the hard controversy indexes are different between design requirements.",,,,
"For R1 (Controversy evolution characterization), the average rating is 5.8, the lowest of the requirements, and it has the highest hard controversy index of 0.45.",,,,
This indicates that participants are polarized for the performance of the controversy evolution presentation.,,,,
"R2 (Aspect presentation) and R3 (Sentiment divergence visualization) receive the high rating of 6.2 and 6.3 with low hard controversy indexes of 0.29 and 0.30, respectively.",,,,
Participants are satisfied with the visual design for aspects and their sentiment divergences.,,,,
They are able to analyze sentiment divergences of aspects effectively using our system.,,,,
"In the questionnaire, R4 (Usability) is divided into two parts, easy to learn and easy to use.",,,,
"The average ratings of these two parts are 5.8 and 5.9 with the hard controversy indexes 0.38 and 0.36, respectively.",,,,
"Most participants report that our system is easy to learn and use, since our design is based on well-known visual representations.",,,,
"According to the record of the task results, all participants could find when a controversy occurs, the main causes of the controversy from the aspect level effectively, and their interested informa,tion.,"","",",,,,
"As Figure 6: Average user rating, hard controversy index, and soft controversy index for R1 (Controversy evolution characterization), R2 (Aspect presentation), R3 (Sentiment divergence visualization,""), an"",d R4 (Eas,""y to learn, Easy to use).,""",,,,
"for participants??opinions in the optional interview session, various suggestions for improvement were proposed.",,,,
"Two out of 10 participants point out that H and S controversy indexes facilitate users identifying controversy when there are sufficient reviews in each time window and they are not effective when t,he re,views are,""sparse.,""",,,,
"H and S are calculated by adding the next time window when there are too few votes in the time window, which may lead to a decrease in the time effectiveness for the controversy evolution presentati,""on.,"",,",,,,
"This could confuse users and cause the hard controversy among users, which is consistent with the questionnaire results of R1.",,,,
"Two out of 10 participants report that it is hard for them to understand the hierarchical clustering process presented in the partition tree view, since they are not familiar with the clustering alg,orith,""m.,"",",,,,
While other participants favor the partition tree view that enables them to examine sentiments of multi-level aspects.,,,,
"One participant mentions that the word cloud would be better for placing features according to their sentiments and another one mentions that labeling an aspect would be more powerful to consider la,beled,aspects,""as input to interactively refine controversy analysis results.,""",,,,
These will be our future work.,,,,
"Overall, most comments indicate that the system is attractive, useful, and enables them to find new information that is important for them but may be less important for others.",,,,
One participant points out that the system is very helpful and should be released.,,,,
"7 C ONCLUSION In this paper, we have proposed a novel visual analytics system leveraging rating and text analysis to interactively detect and interpret the controversy in web reviews.",,,,
This framework could also inspire exploration of the datasets in which structured data and unstructured text co-exist.,,,,
Two hard and soft controversy indexes based on the ratings of reviews are used to characterize the time-evolving controversy trend.,,,,
We have proposed a new aspect-extraction method based on sense embeddings and hierarchical clustering.,,,,
"A new divergence glyph is designed to present aspects with their sentiments, topics, and rating distributions to facilitate visualization and comparison of sentiment divergences of aspects.",,,,
"Our evaluation, including the aspect extraction experiment, three case studies, and the user study, demonstrated the effectiveness and usefulness of our system.",,,,
"Although useful and effective, our system still has some limitations, indicated in the user study.",,,,
"For the limitation concerning the sparsity of the reviews, the hard and soft controversy indexes may be ineffective when the reviews are sparse.",,,,
We plan to incorporate text mining into the controversy quantification to improve the effectiveness of controversy qualification.,,,,
We also intend to combine H and S to visualize controversy more intuitively.,,,,
"Aside from the product domain, we would like to evaluate our aspect-extraction method in other domains in the future.",,,,
Visual analysis of online social media to open up the investigation of stance phenomena Abstract Online social media are a perfect text source for stance analysis.,,,,
"Stance in human communication is concerned with speaker attitudes, beliefs, feelings and opinions.",,,,
Expressions of stance are associated with the speakers??view of what they are talking about and what is up for discussion and negotiation in the intersubjective exchange.,,,,
Taking stance is thus crucial for the social construction of meaning.,,,,
"Increased knowledge of stance can be useful for many application fields such as business intelligence, security analytics, or social media monitoring.",,,,
"In order to process large amounts of text data for stance analyses, linguists need interactive tools to explore the textual sources as well as the processed data based on computational linguistics t,echni,""ques.,"",",,,,
Both original texts and derived data are important for refining the analyses iteratively.,,,,
"In this work, we present a visual analytics tool for online social media text data that can be used to open up the investigation of stance phenomena.",,,,
Our approach complements traditional linguistic analysis techniques and is based on the analysis of utterances associated with two stance categories: sentiment and certainty.,,,,
"Our contributions include (1) the description of a novel web-based solution for analyzing the use and patterns of stance meanings and expressions in human communication over time; and (2) specialize,d tec,hniques u,""sed for visualizing analysis provenance and corpus overview/navigation.,""",,,,
We demonstrate our approach by means of text media on a highly controversial scandal with regard to expressions of anger and provide an expert review from linguists who have been using our tool.,,,,
"Keywords Visual analytics, visualization, text visualization, interaction, time-series, stance analysis, sentiment analysis, text analytics, visual linguistics, online social media, text and documen,t dat,a Introdu,""ction The vast amount of digital data available online provides unprecedented opportunities for automated analyses.,""",,,,
"For example, text data of all kinds make it possible for researchers in the field of linguistics to employ a bottom-up approach to understand various aspects of language: while the traditional way o,f man,ual text,""investigation involved static corpora, linguists nowadays can analyze text data that reflect global events and ongoing language evolution.,""",,,,
"The research on specific language phenomena benefits from text data collected from web sources such as online social media (Twitter, Facebook, blogs, forums, etc.).",,,,
Those \x0ctexts are typically created by multiple authors who are engaged in discussions or refer to each other's messages in which they express their thoughts and opinions.,,,,
This presents an opportunity for researchers who are interested in stance analysis.,,,,
"Stance is a relatively broad concept in linguistics related to (inter-)subjectivity expressed in text or human conversation, for example, attitudes, feelings, perspectives, or judgments.",,,,
Note that stance is not just another concept for subjectivity.,,,,
It is beyond subjectivity in that the process of taking stance itself is evaluative and interactional.,,,,
"Stance could be viewed as a concept that includes sentiment, certainty, and so on as its subcategories.",,,,
Analyzing these subcategories leads toward better understanding of stance.,,,,
"Research on stance includes both theoretical efforts (related to the definition and the knowledge about the nature of this phenomenon) and practical efforts (related to collecting evidence and expla,ining,the mean,""s of taking stance), and it can lead to various text analytics applications.,""",,,,
"The practical tasks require processing large quantities of textual data that are infeasible for manual investigation, for example, providing a temporal overview of stance usage in social media, retr,ievin,g the cor,""responding text data relevant to stance phenomena, or analyzing the occurrences of stance expressions.,""",,,,
"Therefore, stance researchers are interested in automated ways of text processing that can be offered by researchers from the field of computational linguistics or natural language processing (NLP).,"","",,",,,,
"However, many linguists face difficulties when trying to interpret the output of NLP algorithms.",,,,
"For NLP experts, it is equally challenging to gain insight into the underlying text data and to provide useful feedback in order to refine their automatic analyses.",,,,
"In fact, NLP researchers would also benefit from a technique that could improve their understanding of the computational processes associated with the state-ofthe-art NLP algorithms (e.g. it is diff,icult,to inter,""pret the state of a large artificial neural network just by weight matrices).,""",,,,
"This predicament can be resolved by introducing a visual analytics (VA) approach to provide linguistics researchers with interactive visualizations for analyzing large text data and for presenting t,he NL,P experts,""with feedback at the same time.,""",,,,
"Our research project StaViCTA (Advances in the description and explanation of Stance in discourse using Visual and Computational Text Analytics (project web page: http://cs.lnu.se/stavicta/)) addres,ses t,his chall,""enge and aims to produce a refined theory of stance, efficient interactive visualization, and computational techniques for its analysis, as well as solutions for specific applications.,""",,,,
"Due to the early stage of research in stance analysis, the project itself follows an iterative progress plan.",,,,
"Therefore, we consider sentiment analysis, including certainty or uncertainty, as underlying aspects of linguistic stance in order to support the construction of the model in general.",,,,
"In this work, we focus on the exploration of social media documents (in English) and the collection of a training dataset which later will be used to develop appropriate machine learning (ML) approa,ches.,"","",",,,,
"The composed training data consist of text chunks, called utterances, that are associated with specific expressions of stance (see Figure 1).",,,,
These utterances can be used for both NLP purposes and manual linguistic investigation; we denote them by stance markers.,,,,
This collection of relevant stance markers is the basis for a refined theory and sophisticated NLP models for stance analysis in general.,,,,
"Here, we present our tool called uVSAT that can help stance researchers to identify candidate documents that may contain stance expressions, analyze the document texts, and export the new stance mar,kers,(as intro,""duced in our previous poster abstract1).,""",,,,
"uVSAT supports the research task of how we can study the use and patterns of stance meanings and stance expressions in human communication over time in order to investigate what stance markers and s,tance,markings,""are used when, why, how, where, and in what type of dialogic sequences related to the contexts where they occur.,""",,,,
"Our effort described in this article is meant to complement the existing techniques for stance analysis based on manual close reading and traditional linguistic tools by introducing a VA approach to,this,""problem,"",""while not providing a completely automatic stance analysis yet.,""",,,,
"The main contributions of the VA approach presented in this article include the following: \x02 \x02 \x02 A web-based VA solution for investigating stance phenomena based on sentiment analyses of do,cumen,t texts a,""nd time-series; An interactive history diagram for document set queries that facilitates the analysis provenance; Interactive aggregation charts that provide document set overview, navigation, and comparison functionality with regard to stance types or specific stance markers.,""",,,,
The remainder of this article is organized as follows: the next section provides the background of stance analysis from the perspective of linguistics and NLP.,,,,
"The subsequent section covers the related work in text visualization, including work dedicated to sentiment analysis visualization.",,,,
"After this, we explain the system architecture and data model as well as user tasks supported by uVSAT.",,,,
"Then, we describe in \x0cFigure 1.",,,,
The diagram gives an overview of the underlying research problems from the user perspective.,,,,
"To succeed with the analysis of stance, linguists require means to analyze and interact with the output of NLP algorithms as well as means of further manual investigation.",,,,
These means are still missing in the analysis loop and are indicated by the red question mark.,,,,
The dashed edges denote the user operations that depend on the results of interactive visual analysis.,,,,
detail our visualization and interaction approaches for this tool.,,,,
The subsequent section discusses a use case from the linguistics domain based on exploration of data with regard to anger sentiment as a subcategory of stance.,,,,
The penultimate section provides the results of a domain expert review and our reflections about the tool.,,,,
"Finally, we summarize the contributions and future work in the last section.",,,,
Background Our research on visual stance analytics is by nature tightly connected to the domains of linguistics and NLP.,,,,
"Since the problem of stance analysis is not widely discussed in the VA community (as opposed to sentiment analysis), we present the theoretical background of stance and its relation to sentiment in,this,section.,"",""",,,,
"in the light of the contexts and the situations where they are used.2,3 In doing so, language is used to recontextualize human experiences into written and spoken forms.",,,,
"Its social role is to affect the state of mind of other people and to negotiate meanings in order to bring about cognitive changes.4,5 Language users construe their expressions to communicate their,parti,cular per,""spective and viewpoint of what is talked about.,""",,,,
"As the following scheme6 demonstrates, this process of taking stance is evaluative and fundamentally interactional, a type of ongoing negotiation: 1.",,,,
2,,,,

"An utterance proposed by X; Y's engagement (mental processing or interpretation or positioning) as to the utterance in context; Y's response to X's utterance; X's engagement (mental processing o,r int,erpretati,""on or positioning) as to the utterance in context; X's response to Y's utterance; Repeat 2??.,""",,,,
Stance and sentiment model 5.,,,,
6,,,,
Stance is a topical area of interest in linguistics because the interactive nature of communication between individuals is considered vital.,,,,
The function of taking stance in the communicative situation is to convey the speaker's viewpoint of what is talked about and to regulate the exchange between the dialog partners.,,,,
Communication here works on more than the pure understanding of words.,,,,
"Words are always understood Ours is a broad understanding of the process of taking stance, as it is critical to address the subtle but important differences in how people create discourse?봧mbuing i,t wit,h their p,""ersonal word choices as distinct acts of taking stance.,""",,,,
"This encompasses expressions of subjectivity, ranging from individual words to larger chunks of text.",,,,
"These items \x0cexpress speaker's (1) sentiments, (2) attitudes, and (3) beliefs, covering meanings of certainty, volition, evidence, emotion, valence, degree, and so on.",,,,
"Following Du Bois,7 we divide the process of taking stance into three parts: (1) speaker evaluation of what is talked about, (2) speaker positioning (epistemicity), and (3) alignment in communicatio,""n, th"",""at is, es"",""tablishment of agreement or disagreement.,""",,,,
"Stance has been studied under different headings and scope, such as evaluation,8,9 sentiment,10 and appraisal,11 and, of course, under the title stance itself.5,12??4 Yet, at the present time, there,is n,o conclus,""ive and universally accepted definition of linguistic stance.,""",,,,
"As stated above, subcategories of stance include sentiment, certainty or uncertainty, as well as other subcategories that are not well-defined yet.",,,,
"For this article, we have limited the scope of our understanding of stance to sentiment and certainty or uncertainty.",,,,
"These subcategories are generally considered to describe the feelings and assessments of an utterance; as such, they can encapsulate an evaluative statement that is deemed to be a stance act.",,,,
"Our approach is based on the expectation that the occurrences of such expressions lead to occurrences of other stance expressions?봶e denote the particular analyzed subcategories by stance types thr,ougho,ut this a,""rticle to simplify the notation.,""",,,,
"From the computational perspective, this approach could be described as ?섃쁬ultidimensional?쇺?sentiment analysis.",,,,
"Sentiment analysis From an operational point of view, stance includes phenomena such as subjectivity, sentiment, belief, trust, and uncertainty.",,,,
"Some of these phenomena, such as sentiment and subjectivity, have enjoyed considerable attention in the NLP community (for instance, see the works of Pang and Lee,15 Liu,16 and Lin et al.17), while,other,""s, such a"",""s belief, trust, or uncertainty, have remained comparatively peripheral (but there is a number of efforts18,19 to analyze uncertainty and speculation, respectively).,""",,,,
"Sentiment analysis in particular has become a staple in NLP, both in research and in commercial applications, with a large number of vendors offering solutions for social media monitoring where sent,iment,analysis,""is an important part of the analytics suite.,""",,,,
"As with any research area that gains popularity in a research community, there has been a wide variety of approaches suggested in the literature.",,,,
"Examples range from simple keyword matching20 over standard machine learning techniques15,21 to the use of topic modeling algorithms and latent variable models22??4 to deep learning architectures.25,"",26 S"",tate-of-t,""he-art approaches to sentiment analysis now approach, and in some cases even exceed, 90% accuracy on standardized benchmark test suites.21,27,28 Sentiment analysis is normally considered as a classification problem over two or three classes, where positive and negative define the basic polarity, and neutral is used to describe a lack of attitudinal content.,""",,,,
"From the perspective of stance analysis, this is a very simplistic ontology of emotions that is likely to be too restricted to be useful for analyzing and describing complex interpersonal processes,of ta,king stan,""ce.,""",,,,
"Current research on sentiment analysis is beyond the standard positive?뱊egative dichotomy and operates over a wider spectrum of emotions, such as Ekman's29 six basic emotions (the so-called Big Si,x): a,""nger, fea"",""r, happiness, surprise, disgust, and sadness,30 or some other multi-class taxonomy of sentiments.25,31 Another example of a more complex sentiment palette is the RepTrak model used in the RepLab evaluation campaign that includes eight different categories designed specifically for reputation classification.32 As opposed to some of more complex approaches based on ML, we opt for a simplistic approach to sentiment classification for the purposes of the visualization tool in order to preserve transparency and simplicity.,""",,,,
"As previously noted, we have chosen to address stance through subcategories.",,,,
"More specifically in uVSAT, these are based on Ekman's Big Six emotions, employing the NLP solution of simple lexical matching over lists of attitude terms (which we call stance markers as already,menti,oned in t,""he ?섃쁈ntroduction?쇺?section).,""",,,,

"In the following section, we discuss our visualization approach in detail, justify the design decisions, and refer back to the above-listed research questions and tasks.",,,,
Visualization approach The graphical user interface (GUI) of our tool offers a tab-oriented design with two types of tabs (cf.,,,,
"Figures 3 and 4): a single timeline view tab that is used to work with an arbitrary number of timeline plots, and multiple document view tabs that are opened by the user when fetching the document U,RIs f,or select,""ed time intervals.,""",,,,
"As the timeline view is the entry point of all visual analyses supported by our approach, we start our discussion with this view.",,,,
Timeline view The timeline view tab (cf.,,,,
Figure 3) provides the users with the interfaces for exploring time-series data for selected targets or observers and specified time intervals.,,,,
"Note that fetching the input data to be analyzed?봳hat is, the initial selection of specific targets, observers, and time ranges?봣rom the Gavagai server is done via a simple dialog box as explained,in o,ur use ca,""se (cf.,""",,,,
the corresponding section).,,,,
"In this section, we concentrate on overall design aspects including visual representation and interaction possibilities.",,,,
Color coding considerations.,,,,
"Before we address the particular representations, we have to explain the color coding scheme used for the timeline view as well as document views.",,,,
"As mentioned in subsection ?섃쁃ata model,?쇺?the analyses supported by our tool involve the combinations of targets Ti and specific observers Oik.",,,,
"So, the resulting hierarchical data structure for one specific target might be (diet, {anger, joy, .",,,,
"}), for instance.",,,,
"The time-series data fetched from our partners are organized this way with the focus on target??observer combinations, and our initial choice of the color coding was based on the decision to provide,a un,ique colo,""r for each combination.,""",,,,
"However, this approach had two issues: first, the sheer number of combinations (45 entries in our present set of target??observer combinations) made it difficult to use a color scheme that would fac,ilita,te the us,""ers??perception of the data and, second, this color scheme was not related to the scheme for document views (described below), so the users could easily lose the mental map when switching between the view tabs.,""",,,,
"The analyses employed by document views (see the corresponding subsection below) concentrate on the observers, that is, stance types, and do not differentiate between observers related to various ta,rgets,"".,"",",,,,
"This had an implication that the color coding for document views was initially based on ColorBrewer,76 and it contained separate colors for observers and targets.",,,,
"Afterward, we have changed the color coding used for the timeline view in accordance to the TreeColors approach.77 To generate the colors, we have inverted our hierarchy to the form {(Oj, {Tj1, ., T,ji})j,1 4 j 4 m,"",1 4 i 4 n}, for instance, (joy, {diet, Hobbit, .,""",,,,
"}), and then used the TreeColors package.",,,,
The resulting color coding aims to assign different observers distinct color hues although it is not perfect since there are still too many of those.,,,,
The colors assigned to target?뱋bserver combinations pertaining to the same observer have rather similar hues.,,,,
"This, on one hand, makes it simple to spot such similar combinations.",,,,
"On the other hand, although, it makes it difficult to discern such plots?봳his is partially alleviated by interaction techniques such as details on hover and filtering.",,,,
"Overall, the main benefit of this approach is that it allows of using the same color hues for \x0c\x0c\x0cobservers across the timeline and document views that helps to preserve the users??mental ma,""p.,"",,",,,,
Data hierarchy view.,,,,
"After the input data have been loaded, the users are provided with the data hierarchy view displayed in Figure 3(a) that shows the hierarchical structure of the available target?뱋bserver combinatio,""ns.,"",,",,,,
Users can also open a tab with iconic ?섃쁮verview plots?쇺?(cf.,,,,
Figure 10) for all fetched time-series which are similar to regular timeline plots with highlighted regions of interest (ROIs) (see below).,,,,
These overview plots support a simple way to compare the time-series and to find more general patterns in the data (research questions Q1 and Q2).,,,,
"As soon as interesting target??observer combinations are found, the user may want to investigate these data in detail and drag-and-drop the entries from the data hierarchy view onto the main part of,the,""tab.,"",",,,,
"Then, uVSAT displays the timeline plots for the chosen combinations.",,,,
"For instance, in Figure 3, a user has selected three views where several target?뱋bserver combinations are visualized.",,,,
Timeline plots.,,,,
uVSAT uses a standard line plot representation for time-series data (cf.,,,,
Figure 3(b)) and supports usual interaction techniques for such plots (research question Q1).,,,,
We have chosen this visual representation as our domain experts are already familiar with it.,,,,
"In addition, line plots can be easily extended with additional graphical features.",,,,
"Details on hover, plot overview, and scroll and zoom are provided by default by the Rickshaw component.",,,,
Users are also able to filter the plots with regard to visible target??observer combinations by switching on and off the corresponding labels.,,,,
"Our tool supports multiple plots displayed on the same canvas (users can drag-and-drop additional items from the data hierarchy view) or separately (users can drag the plot containers to change the,timel,ine view,""layout).,""",,,,
"For the comparison of several plots displayed side by side, users can control the automatic vertical scaling?봟y default, plots are scaled to fit the containers.",,,,
This functionality was explicitly wished by our domain experts.,,,,
ROI highlighting.,,,,
"To facilitate the search for ROIs, our tool also supports automatic ROI highlighting (research question Q2).",,,,
"Currently, we use a basic ad hoc algorithm for marking the ROIs based on outlier or differential analysis.",,,,
"As a first step of the algorithm, time-series points xi are marked, which differ significantly (with regard to threshold parameters u1 and u2) either from the mean value mx (standard deviation sx is,used,for comp,""arison) or from the preceding point (judging by the first derivative x0i ) Since the source time-series data are in general noisy, A will result in multiple regions of small size (comprising only one or several points).,""",,,,
"Therefore, in the second step, we smooth the results by marking neighboring points as parts of ROI, which will result in contiguous regions ROI = A [ fxi : 챨xi\x031 2 A횧 _ 챨xi + 1 2 A횧g ROIs are,high,lighted b,""y thick line segments (cf.,""",,,,
Figure 3(b)).,,,,
"The algorithm parameters u1 and u2 can be adjusted by the user, which can be used to partially alleviate the problem of noisy data or to increase or reduce the number of highlighted regions to focus,on.,"","",",,,,
Trend analysis.,,,,
Users have several options of conducting trend analyses over selected time intervals for specified observers (cf.,,,,
Figure 3(c)).,,,,
uVSAT supports linear and quadratic time-series trend analysis based on polynomial regression (calculated with the ordinary least squares (OLS) method).,,,,
We implemented two variations: one can choose to either render trends as overlay plots (cf.,,,,
Figure 5(a)) or to substitute selected timeline plot segments with trend lines (cf.,,,,
Figure 5(b)) to reduce the visual complexity of the displayed data (research questions Q1 and Q2).,,,,
Trend lines are easily distinguishable by the use of dashed lines.,,,,
Even information about the predicted value change at the current trend rate and a button for removing trend lines are available on hover.,,,,
Document URI links queries.,,,,
"As soon as the user is more interested in the concrete documents whose frequencies are represented by the different time plots, he or she can select time intervals for specific sets of observers and,load,the corr,""esponding URI links to the documents (research question Q3).,""",,,,
"In this case, a new \x0cFigure 6.",,,,
The history diagram allows users to keep track of document queries and navigate between interface states.,,,,
document view tab is created and a thumbnail of the line plot used for the query is displayed in this new view in order to preserve the mental map.,,,,
An example of this thumbnail can be seen in Figure 4 in the left upper corner.,,,,
et al.82 to decrease the number of edge crossings when allocating edges to the upper or lower part of the drawing.,,,,
"The interactive history covers the following functionalities: every time a user issues a URI links query that leads to the creation of a new document view tab, the state of this new tab and the time,line,view tab,""are saved and a corresponding node is added to the history diagram.,""",,,,
"When the user clicks on a history node, the timeline view tab state is restored, a document view tab with corresponding state is either created or brought into focus (if currently present), and the,user,actions t,""emporarily stop affecting the history state (e.g. issuing a new query will not add the resulting state to history)?봶e have chosen such behavior to keep the history sequential.,""",,,,
"When the user clicks on the triangle, the previously saved up-to-date state is restored.",,,,
"Under circumstances, this can lead to some document view tabs getting closed.",,,,
"Document views History diagram Since the workflow of uVSAT involves multiple document view tabs that also may be closed by a user during the analysis process, the need for overview and control of su,ch us,er action,""s arises.,""",,,,
Our interactive history diagram (cf.,,,,
"Figure 3(d) and Figure 6) provides an overview of the document URI queries sequence, their results, and relations to each other (research questions Q6 and Q7).",,,,
"In this diagram that supports the so-called analysis provenance,78 nodes represent URI queries and edges represent the detected relations between corresponding query results (this partially resemble,s the,visualiz,""ation approach described by Cernea et al.79).,""",,,,
The size of every node is proportional to the number of URI links retrieved for the corresponding query.,,,,
"Nodes are represented by glyphs similar to pie charts (although only qualitative information about relevant observers is used), following the same color coding of observers as the timeline plots.",,,,
The currently selected node is highlighted in yellow.,,,,
"Since the diagram is used for history navigation, it also contains a dedicated node (depicted by a triangle) that represents the up-to-date interface state.",,,,
Edges connect only nodes whose query results contain common subsets of URI links.,,,,
The size of common subsets (i.e.,,,,
"Jaccard similarity of link sets80) is mapped to edge opacity, thickness, or both of these attributes (selected as a user setting).",,,,
"The layout of the history diagram is based on arc diagrams by Wattenberg:81 nodes are simply aligned along a horizontal axis in the order of corresponding queries, and edges are rendered as curved a,rcs.,"","",",,,,
We apply a random-order greedy heuristic described by He A document view tab (cf.,,,,
Figure 4) basically consists of two areas.,,,,
"The left (smaller) area provides information about all documents fetched based on the selection described at the end of subsection ?섃쁔imeline view.?쇺?Thus, it shows the aforementioned line plot,thum,bnail use,""d for the query as well as a link list (cf.,""",,,,
"Figure 4(a)) to HTML documents (blog posts, forum messages, etc.)",,,,
that were marked as associated with a specific target?뱋bserver combination.,,,,
Users can filter the list by URI domain and sort it by the timestamp value or by polarization value (as reported by the Gavagai server).,,,,
Polarization values are also used for the color coding of list entries (research question Q3).,,,,
"By selecting a link from the list, the corresponding document content is fetched, processed at the (visualization) server side, and rendered at the client side.",,,,
"If the content is not available at this time, the corresponding list entry is marked.",,,,
The document data at this stage are raw HTML which affects the analysis.,,,,
This is because the source code comments and metadata (such as keywords) often contain text irrelevant to the document content.,,,,
"To direct the user's focus on textual document data, uVSAT renders the HTML content as plain text by using the Jericho library.83 All data and analysis results related to the single focus document,are s,hown in t,""he second area on the righthand side of the document list.,""",,,,
"This area integrates four subviews: the current document view, the current document details view (not further discussed here), the document marker view, and the current document overview.",,,,
"It should be noted that uVSAT also provides an opportunity to copy the query link for a given \x0cdocument view tab and to use it in later analysis sessions by opening a tab with identical contents,(rese,arch ques,""tion Q6).,""",,,,
marker for a specific stance type mostly occurs in the context of another marker.,,,,
Aggregation charts Current document view.,,,,
Figure 4(b) displays the text representation of a document.,,,,
The stance markers and target terms are highlighted and support brushing in coordination with the other views (research question Q4).,,,,
"The motivation for the color coding for document view tabs was described above: it uses a scheme with eight colors for stance markers and a separate scheme with five colors based on ColorBrewer for,targe,t terms s,""ince targets share stance markers associated with observers (types of stance), for example, the word ?섃쁟ommendable?쇺?is a marker of joy for both Hobbit and Coca-Cola.,""",,,,
"To distinguish target terms from stance markers, the former are marked by a striped background pattern.",,,,
Document marker view.,,,,
Information about stance markers (and their occurrence counts) as well as target terms detected in the current document is summarized in the document marker view (cf.,,,,
Figure 4(c)).,,,,
"The stance markers for each observer are sorted by their counts to facilitate user investigations (note that target terms occurrences do not affect the statistics since such terms are not directly r,elate,d to expr,""essions of stance).,""",,,,
The users can navigate the document with regard to markers or terms occurrences and to filter them (research question Q4).,,,,
Current document overview.,,,,
"To give users an overview of marker or term distributions in the current document (and an additional means of navigation), uVSAT provides several visual representations displayed in Figure 4(d).",,,,
"First of all, a two-dimensional (2D) overview is visualized by mapping the current positions of all markers or terms onto a canvas (they are represented by circles and diamonds, respectively).",,,,
The current viewport is displayed as a rectangle.,,,,
This overview supports navigation by clicking on a plot item or the canvas.,,,,
"Additionally, a separate one-dimensional (1D) overview for each observer and target is visualized by projecting the positions of corresponding markers or terms onto a vertical axis.",,,,
Such overviews help the users to immediately perceive the distributions over the document length since the 2D overview can become cluttered in case of numerous markers or terms.,,,,
1D overviews support document navigation by clicking on plot items.,,,,
"Seeing such distributions is especially interesting for our domain experts because it is important for a better understanding of stance in discourse (research question Q4), for instance, if a While,the t,echniques,""discussed above allow the users to analyze a selected document in detail and provide an indication of interesting documents (by polarization values), the document sets retrieved for certain queries may contain thousands of documents, and the users will benefit from a method that helps them to select documents that are interesting for further stance marker investigation (research question Q5).,""",,,,
"uVSAT addresses this problem with a technique that we call aggregation charts: it provides an informative overview and means of navigation for the current document set with regard to detected marker,s and,observer,""s (cf.,""",,,,
Figures 7 and 8).,,,,
"The visual representation is based on basic bubble charts described by Vie?gas et al.84 Every item in the chart represents a single document which corresponds to the target; the color coding is base,d on,the nomin,""al target values.,""",,,,
A single item is visually represented by a glyph consisting of two nested circles.,,,,
"The size of the outer circle is proportional to the total number of corresponding stance markers detected in the document, and the size of the inner circle (filled with a more saturated color) is pr,oport,ional to,""the number of unique marker types detected in the document.,""",,,,
"For instance, a document with 100 occurrences of a marker ?섃쁤ood?쇺?and 100 occurrences of a marker ?섃쁞ad?쇺?has only two unique marker types: ?섃쁤ood?쇺?and ?섃쁞ad.?쇺?The aggregated,data,used for,""these charts can be organized in two ways: by observer and by stance marker.,""",,,,
"In the former case, a separate chart is visualized for each observer associated with the document set.",,,,
"In the latter case, one individual chart is visualized for each unique marker type (belonging to present observers) that has been detected in at least one document.",,,,

Marker and document export One aim of our visualization tool is to identify and collect relevant stance markers from a larger number of analyzed documents (research question Q8).,,,,
"uVSAT supports the export of new stance markers from document view tabs by selecting a portion of text in the current document view (depicted in Figure 4(c)), assigning it with arbitrary tags, and e,xport,ing it to,""a JSON file.,""",,,,
This approach allows us to collect a dataset of stance markers not restricted by the categories currently used for observers.,,,,
"Moreover, we are able not only to collect stance markers as short phrases (1grams,85 2-grams, or similar) but also to collect larger utterances which provide context for stance analysis.",,,,
Our tool also supports the export of currently viewed documents and aggregation charts as static HTML pages.,,,,
"In the former case, the document view with highlighted stance markers and target terms, document details, hierarchical markers view, and document overview (essentially, all the data pertaining to th,e cur,rent docu,""ment on a document view tab) are exported.,""",,,,
"In the latter case, all aggregation charts that are currently available are exported together with the corresponding document set query (used observers, selected time interval, etc.).",,,,
"This feature allows users to store static data for further manual investigation or referencing, which can be especially helpful for researchers in linguistics.",,,,
"Use case: linguistics research The use case described here is one in which a linguist has chosen to analyze negative sentiments of stance (focusing on anger) in blogs, within a limited 1-week time f,rame.,"","",",,,,
This example illustrates how researchers in linguistics benefit from our tool when conducting stance analysis.,,,,
The event chosen was the highly controversial Coca-Cola commercial presented during Super Bowl XLVIII86 (3 February 2014 CET).,,,,
The aims of the analysis are the following: A1.,,,,
Analyze the overall usage of stance-related sentiments for the scandal time span; A2.,,,,
Identify the document with the largest number of markers of anger; A3.,,,,
Identify the most frequently used anger markers; A4.,,,,
Analyze how such markers are used in the previously identified document; A5.,,,,
Finalize the choice of the detected document for further linguistic research.,,,,
"For performing an accurate analysis, data revealing information about the communicative forces and the attitudes to the ideas discussed at different points in time as well as possible relationships,betwe,en those,""attitudes must be made available to the researcher.,""",,,,
"By using uVSAT, the linguist is able to analyze these aspects of the social media data which would be impossible for manual stance analysis.",,,,
"Timeline data analysis First, the researcher uses the Load data dialog box and selects all Coca-Cola observers for the time interval 30 January 2014 12:00?? February 2014 12:00 CET in order to obtai,n a v,ery broad,""return of data (cf.,""",,,,
Figure 9).,,,,
The time-series calculated for corresponding observers are loaded from Gavagai API.,,,,
By viewing the hierarchy and overview tabs (cf.,,,,
"Figure 10), the researcher verifies that all of the chosen observers have been loaded and confirms that there are sufficient data to be analyzed.",,,,
"The researcher immediately notices the spike of activity on multiple plots around early hours of 3 February CET, which corresponds to the late evening of 2 February EST?봳he time when the advertisem,ent w,as aired,""in the United States (aim A1).,""",,,,
"Then, the researcher creates timeline plots by dragging-and-dropping the observer items onto the timeline view.",,,,
"Using the slider control, the researcher concentrates on the time span 3 February 2014 01:00?? February 2014 19:00 CET.",,,,
"To confirm a conjecture that some of the observers have extremely low counts in the current time span (aim A1), the researcher filters them out.",,,,
"The remaining observers are certainty, joy, uncertainty, and anger (see Figure 11).",,,,
"To start analyzing the textual data, the researcher issues a request for corresponding URIs.",,,,
Identifying the document of interest The resulting URI set comprises 3424 document links.,,,,
"While the researcher could explore this dataset manually, it would take a significant amount of time to achieve aim A2.",,,,
"At this point, the researcher decides to build the aggregation charts for the current document set and to investigate the charts organized by observer.",,,,
"For this, the text document data are \x0cFigure 9.",,,,
The dialog box used to select the time intervals and target?뱋bserver combinations to load time-series data.,,,,

fetched from respective web servers and processed by uVSAT.,,,,
The aggregation chart for anger (cf.,,,,
Figure 12) comprises 1948 documents which in total contain 154 unique markers of anger.,,,,
"The researcher immediately identifies two candidate documents with the largest number of corresponding markers which are represented by glyphs with the largest diameters (also, with large shaded are,as wh,ich means,""large number of unique marker types).,""",,,,
"By hovering on these glyphs, the researcher finds out that one of them contains 142 occurrences of anger markers (39 unique types) and another one contains 193 occurrences (41 unique types).",,,,
The researcher selects the latter glyph by clicking and loads the corresponding document.,,,,
The loaded document of interest (depicted in Figure 13) is a blog post87 with a heated discussion in commentaries.,,,,
"To concentrate on the analysis of anger markers, the researcher filters out all markers of other observers.",,,,
"The current document overview plots at the bottom of the screenshot clearly show that the markers of anger, as well as the target terms of Coca-Cola, are \x0cFigure 11.",,,,
"Timeline view: four observers for target Coca-Cola that are used for detailed analysis are certainty, joy, uncertainty, and anger.",,,,
Figure 12.,,,,
The aggregation chart for anger provides an opportunity to identify the document with the largest number of corresponding stance marker occurrences.,,,,
There seem to be two candidate documents which are represented by large glyphs (also with large shaded area).,,,,
"By hovering on these glyphs, the one with larger count of markers (in this case, 193 occurrences) is identified and later used for detailed analysis.",,,,
evenly distributed throughout the entire document.,,,,
"To refine the analysis, the researcher needs to concentrate on specific markers.",,,,
Identifying the markers of anger The aggregation charts for the current document set can be organized by stance marker instead of observer.,,,,
The researcher selects this option and explores the resulting set of 605 aggregation charts (one per each unique stance marker type).,,,,
"Since the charts are ordered by marker occurrences number in descending order, the researcher quickly identifies several most frequent markers of anger, thus achieving aim A3 (see Table 1).",,,,
"Final document analysis After identifying the most frequent markers of anger using the aggregation charts (here: ?섃쁥ate,?쇺??섃쁝ngry,?쇺??섃쁮ffended,?쇺?etc.",,,,
"), the researcher concentrates on the previously selected document and filters out all the other markers.",,,,
It turns out that some of the identified markers are also among the most frequent markers of anger in the document as well (cf.,,,,
Table 2).,,,,
The researcher reviews the current document overview once more (cf.,,,,
Figure 14) and concludes that the identified markers are also distributed throughout this document.,,,,
"As the observer anger has the marker ?섃쁥ate?쇺?prolifically used, the analyst investigates further, addressing the linguistic characteristics that are employed by users who have posted these.",,,,
The linguist \x0c\x0cpositively guided the investigation.,,,,
"By viewing the aggregation charts, the researcher's decisions were visually supported, and he or she was able to draw the conclusions about stance phenomena in the dataset.",,,,
"The potential for employing these different refinement possibilities lets the researcher review statistical plots that are dynamic and updated as new postings are incorporated into the document view,"".,"",,",,,,
The analysis features provided by the document view complements the manual stance analysis based on close reading.,,,,
"Overall, the patterns constructed by uVSAT create an ample opportunity for the researcher to employ userbased data en masse.",,,,
"On a final note, the linguist began with one specific study area.",,,,
"After using uVSAT, the researcher concluded that the data have also revealed three other possible areas of interest: (1) directionality and frequency of the anger markers, that is, who the poster in,tends,as the r,""ecipients and how often they appear and respond; (2) instances of how posters modify their use of anger, that is, intensifiers or attenuators; and (3) if anger is negated so as to create a positive meaning.,""",,,,
The tool has provided several new potentials for future lines of research that could have gone unnoticed if traditional linguistic investigations were used.,,,,
"Expert reviews and discussion now proceeds with a close analysis of the document giving critical attention to the markers ?섃쁥ate,?쇺??섃쁮ffended,?쇺?and ?섃쁝ngry,?쇺?thus achieving aim A4.,"","",,",,,,
"The researcher's conclusion is that the identified document is interesting for further manual linguistic analysis with regard to the flow of the conversation, and so on, as well as for preparation,of an,ML train,""ing dataset.,""",,,,
"By exporting the document from uVSAT, the linguist achieves aim A5.",,,,
"Summary By using uVSAT, the researcher has been able to achieve his or her analysis aims, that is, exploring the data related to the case, analyzing the stance-related phenomena of anger and exporti,ng th,e analyze,""d text data.,""",,,,
"By being able to interpret the ROIs on the timeline view, the researcher was able to limit a great amount of documents to an amount for a more detailed review.",,,,
"The tool's ability to visualize multiple markers simultaneously in the document overview In this section, we present the results of two domain expert reviews as well as performance issues.",,,,
"Based on these findings, we discuss some lessons learned during the development and testing phase of uVSAT.",,,,
"Domain expert reviews For the time being, our research partners at Lund University have been the primary users of uVSAT.",,,,
"They are familiar with standard tools for corpus analysis (e.g. AntConc, BYU-BNC, WORDSMITH, or Google Ngram Viewer) and manual text analysis.",,,,
"As a kind of project preparation, we introduced basic visualization concepts and techniques to them at the beginning of our collaboration.",,,,
"Their suggestions and feedback during the design and development stage of uVSAT are summarized in the following with regard to general analysis workflow, visualization and interaction techniques, an,d pos,sible imp,""rovements for the tool.,""",,,,
General analysis workflow.,,,,
The experts have been very enthusiastic about the opportunity to analyze a large number of online social media documents in detail with regard to stance and sentiment in an interactive way.,,,,
"They have noted that their usual tools of \x0cchoice in most cases require text preprocessing and employ static or rarely updated corpora, as opposed to our approach: The uVSAT tool can accommodate,the t,ime facto,""r and help the analyst sift through large amounts of data where important chunks could easily be overlooked.,""",,,,
"Using the uVSAT tool, which is visually driven to reveal patterns, the researcher can track these and follow how language is being shaped by current digital communications.",,,,
The experts have also appreciated the fact that uVSAT is implemented as a web application which does not require a specific OS or installation or update procedures.,,,,
Interactive visualization approach.,,,,
The feedback on the design of both timeline and document views has been positive.,,,,
"The experts have approved of the features facilitating the time-series analysis, in particular, they have liked that ROI highlighting is turned on by default.",,,,
The experts have commended the usage of color coding to highlight the ROIs as well as the markers or terms.,,,,
They have also approved our decision to convert HTML documents into plain text in order to concentrate on the text content in the document view tabs.,,,,
"The experts have also been very positive about the aggregation charts as a means of overview, pattern detection, and navigation: Aggregation charts give extremely comprehensive views that are easily,unde,rstood by,""this user.,""",,,,
"These images result in giving the researcher a direct visual confirmation of the number of markers, which then can be scrolled through, chosen and loaded.",,,,
"The ability to export stance markers as well the content for further manual investigation was also commented on: This gives the user a pro-active involvement in the ongoing improvement of the tool t,hat i,s neither,""confusing nor time-consuming.,""",,,,
Possible improvements.,,,,
One of the experts??suggestions during the development was related to the comparison of several timeline plots.,,,,
"We have addressed it by providing an ability to control the layout of the timeline view and to disable the automatic vertical scaling which allows the user to compare the plots situated side by side,"".,"",,",,,,
"The feedback also included some complaints related to the tool performance (see below in the next subsection) as well as a wish for additional functionality related to document set overview (e.g. cl,uster,ing the d,""ocuments in aggregation charts by the URL domain).,""",,,,
"We have also learned that the trend analysis feature is only rarely used since it currently focuses on already-available time-series data?봳herefore, we are planning to extend this feature by suppor,ting,predictiv,""e trend analysis to increase its level of utility.,""",,,,
Summary.,,,,
The experts have stated that uVSAT is a useful addition into their arsenal of stance analysis techniques.,,,,
"They are using it to explore and analyze the social media data and complement it with manual stance analysis as well as by processing the exported data with other software tools, for example, for co,ncord,ance anal,""ysis.,""",,,,
"They have also started to collect the ML training dataset, thus achieving the general design goals.",,,,
"In general, the domain experts have concluded the following: For a linguist, uVSAT is a viable tool for working with stance analysis.",,,,
"Performance and scalability In this subsection, we discuss certain aspects that affect the user experience when trying to apply uVSAT for the analysis of rather large datasets: data transmission del,""ays,"",data proc,""essing delays, and user interface responsiveness.,""",,,,
We currently store neither time-series data nor document text data on our visualization server.,,,,
"Hence, uVSAT issues request for time-series data, URIs, and HTML content from external servers on demand.",,,,
This leads to delays while retrieving the source data.,,,,
"Additional delays occur while transmitting the data between the front-end and back-end components and, finally, while processing the data at the server side.",,,,
We address the networking delay by conducting some types of analyses (such as ROI highlighting or trend computations) on the client side.,,,,
"It currently seems, although, that the performance bottleneck is the step of fetching the HTML content from numerous external servers which may have varying connection speed, performance, access fre,quenc,y limitat,""ions, and even availability.,""",,,,
"We plan to introduce a local database for caching the external data (as well as some processing results), although it can lead to validity concerns (see subsection ?섃쁋essons learned?쇺?.",,,,
As for the UI responsiveness: D3 and Rickshaw use SVG for rendering which may require significant computational resources (and leads to UI lags).,,,,
"On a 2013 MacBook Pro computer with Intel Core i7 processor \x0c(2.3 GHz), sensible UI delays start to occur when rerendering plots with a total of about 3000 points.",,,,
This is partially addressed with a style of workflow involving preliminary analysis of time-series overview and focusing on selected time intervals.,,,,
Lessons learned Our current visualization approach involves multiple coordinated views based on standard representations.,,,,
"Its main advantage (as opposed to a more complex integrated view) is the ease of user adoption: the primary users of our tool are researchers in linguistics who do not tolerate abundant details or u,nintu,itive vis,""ual representations.,""",,,,
"The corresponding disadvantage, however, is the necessity of large display area to lay out all the views in sufficient size.",,,,
"We plan to address this issue in the future by developing novel visual representations for stance-related and timedependent text data, having the domain particularities in mind.",,,,
The fact that our source data originate in online social media also has certain consequences: the text documents may be edited or deleted at any time.,,,,
This presents us with a trade-off between data validity and performance.,,,,
"By fetching online data on user's demand (as uVSAT currently does), every document is analyzed in its up-to-date state (or it is marked as unavailable), but it requires computational resources (and,it i,s also re,""lated to inevitable networking delays).,""",,,,
"Otherwise, if the data are cached while the original data are modified, it would invalidate the detailed analysis of document contents.",,,,
"To address this issue, we plan to involve uncertainty tackling techniques.",,,,
"Another possibility would involve storing the versioned source documents?봶hile in practice, it would require significant resources, in theory, it could provide an analysis opportunity with regard t,o add,itional t,""emporal dimension.,""",,,,
reading with a VA approach that allows the researchers to use massive datasets originating from social media.,,,,
"The contributions of this article include the description of a VA tool that contains multiple approaches for analyzing temporal and textual data as well as exporting stance markers in order to prepa,re a,stanceori,""ented training dataset.,""",,,,
"We also presented special visualization techniques developed for our tool: the history diagram (for document set query analysis provenance) and the aggregation charts (for document set overview, nav,igati,""on, and c"",""omparison).,""",,,,
"We already used uVSAT for the purposes of the StaViCTA project, and we provided feedback from the linguistics experts in this article.",,,,
"Using uVSAT, our researchers in linguistics have been able to collect stance markers that are now being used to define stance categories other than sentiment and certainty or uncertainty (e.g. conce,ssion,s and jud,""gment).,""",,,,
The tool is currently being used for collecting documents that form the training dataset for our researchers in NLP as well as for actual stance analysis conducted by the linguists.,,,,
We are convinced that our tool will be useful for other interested researchers.,,,,
"Future work includes additional overview and navigation techniques for document sets, support for local database caching, streaming data, uncertainty tackling (with regard to missing time-series dat,a as,well as u,""navailable web documents), and arbitrary time-series data sources.,""",,,,
"In order to provide our tool to others, we will develop our own (more lightweight) analysis engine to become independent from Gavagai.",,,,
We also plan to conduct a larger study to evaluate the effectiveness of single techniques such as history diagram and aggregation charts.,,,,

These utterances are then piled up at the edge of the space.,,,,
Each utterance in this view is represented by a colored dot with the size corresponding to the length of its underlying text.,,,,
"As the sizes of utterances are defined to all fit into their corresponding segment in the Topic-Space, we do not aggregate the utterances as is usual for visual sedimentation-based visualizations.",,,,
This choice has the main advantage that we can roughly retrace the sequence of utterances in a topic-segment by their distance to the edge of the space.,,,,
"Utterances close to the edge are spoken at the beginning of the conversation and utterances close to the center of the space occurred later in the discussion, as shown in Figure 4. can be used to en,code,informati,""on about the underlying utterances, such as length or sentiment value.,""",,,,
"Interacting with these overlays enables the users to get more details about the utterances and speakers on demand and facilitates the detailed analysis of the linguistic and statistical features of,the t,""ext.,"",",,,,
Such a detailed analysis of single utterances is key to proving the hypotheses of the analysts and allows the generation of real empirical evidence through going down to the annotated text level.,,,,
"For analyzing speech and argumentation patterns, users, therefore, rely on the interaction with the argumentation glyphs and the speaker paths.",,,,
These glyphs represent abstractions of important features for their analysis and are the doorway to the concrete texts.,,,,
The design of the argumentation glyphs is discussed in the next section.,,,,

"Speech and Argumentation Patterns When analyzing conversations, analysts are usually trying to find measurable evidence to support their hypotheses about the dynamics of a conversation.",,,,
"Depending on the analysis task at hand, different statistical and linguistic features may form a solution.",,,,
"In contrast to the task-independent algorithms deployed for generating the Topic-Space views, measures for detecting task-relevant patterns are usually depending on the language usage and general te,xt qu,""ality.,"",",,,,
"In order to satisfy the requirements of the analysis, we need to tailor the choice and visual design of the measures to the concrete analysis.",,,,
"Hence, in the context of political discourse analysis, we extract features that highlight the dynamics of a political debate.",,,,

Speaker-Path View The last view features the complete speaker path for a selected speaker.,,,,
This view shows a static path that indicates the complete movement of a speaker through the conversation.,,,,
"As with the speaker-trails, these paths are calculated using b-spline interpolations.",,,,
"In contrast to linear interpolation, the calculated splines avoid occlusion of path segments.",,,,
Depending on the activity and participation of a speaker in the conversation these paths might get visually cluttered and thus harder to understand.,,,,
"Therefore, we include the feature of retracing the paths using the animated speaker dots in order to reconstruct the movement patterns.",,,,
"Using the various selection and filtering methods embedded in ConToVi , the overplotting of long paths can be reduced.",,,,
The main task of this view is to enable a focused analysis of one speaker and to allow the comparison of multiple speaker paths.,,,,
Comparing paths can be achieved through overlay in the same Topic-space or by a side-byside comparison.,,,,
This feature is important to address tasks related to speaker similarity.,,,,
Figure 5 shows a comparative view of three participants of the Stuttgart 21 arbitration.,,,,
"Hereby, the topics addressed by each speaker become clear.",,,,
"The moderator of the arbitration Dr. Heiner Gei횩ler moves back and forth between all topics over the course of the discussion, while the other speakers address topics more specifically.",,,,
"In addition to the animated speaker dots, this view enables the overlay of the different design elements, such as topic or argumentation glyphs.",,,,
"Moreover, the width and color saturation of the path For assessing the deliberative quality of debates, speech and argumentation patterns of speakers are particularly interesting.",,,,
Together with our domain expert we derived a set of features that are inferred from the theoretical dimensions of deliberation based on Steenbergen et al. [SBSS03].,,,,
"For detecting speakers??speech patterns, we use a rule-based annotation system to extract speaker stances.",,,,
"In general, the approach is based on a lexical-grounded procedure [BHJSB14], annotating the occurrence of deliberative relations within utterances.",,,,
These relations are defined through a combination of nominal attributes that are extracted using a set of rules from the text.,,,,
"In essence, the rules disambiguate the usage of functional words and connectors in the text that indicate speaker stances towards their utterances and define the parts of the text that indicate thes,e sta,""nces.,"",",,,,
"For our tool, we use the most common 8 speaker stances to characterize the utterances.",,,,
Since the usage of other stances is generally very infrequent they are not shown in our visualizations.,,,,
"To model the argumentation patterns of speakers we extract the scope of arguments within an utterance with respect to justification, i.e.",,,,
reason and conclusion.,,,,
"Using the lexical-grounded procedure, we extract not only the occurrence of justification in an argument but also its scope within an utterance.",,,,
"In general, the level of uncertainty in the identification of these markers is low.",,,,
4.1.,,,,
Argumentation Glyphs The argumentation glyphs are abstract representations of some important linguistic features of speech and argumentation.,,,,
"For the analysis of deliberation, we designed the argumentation glyph to encode the above-mentioned features, in addition to \x0cthe length of an utterance.",,,,
These 11 dimensions are carefully mapped to visual elements in the glyphs to give a quick understanding of the mapping and a fast recognition.,,,,
"All ten speech and argumentation attributes have a double visual encoding to enhance a pre-attentive cognition of the information, in compliance with Borgo et al. [BKC??13] design guidelines (DG5).,"","",,",,,,
The size of the glyph corresponds to the length of a given utterance.,,,,
"For the argumentation patterns, the degree of justification of a speaker is measured using two indicators: (A) Reason, i.e.",,,,
explanation and justification of the argument.,,,,
"(B) Conclusion, i.e.",,,,
results of the argument.,,,,
Both indicators are measured in relation to the utterance length and are visually represented by the outer segments of the glyph.,,,,
These segments encode the relative amount of both indicators by their size and color (white/light-gray for 0% to black for 100%).,,,,
The eight nominal dimensions of speaker stances are mapped to equally-sized circle-segments in the inside of the glyph.,,,,
These features are mapped to both color and angle (position).,,,,
The choice of the colors ensured that dimensions that highly-correlate in practice are assigned different colors.,,,,
The argumentation glyphs can be mapped on to the different views of the Topic-Space to represent an abstraction of the utterances.,,,,
"They are used interchangeably with the topic glyphs, depending on the analysis task.",,,,
"In Figure 6, a subset of the glyphs of three speakers from the Stuttgart 21 arbitration is shown.",,,,
"With the help of this table view, the evolution of the argumentative structure of a speaker and her behavior can be analyzed.",,,,
"While analyzing the patterns for different speakers, users tend to immediately detect typical glyphs for each speaker and thus are able to spot outliers in the conversation.",,,,
"When an outlier is found, it is important for analysts to be able to analyze the underlying text of its corresponding utterance manually to disclose automatic processing mistakes and to verify their,hypo,""theses.,"",",,,,
"For such a detailed inspection, we provide a text-level analysis.",,,,

"However, only one of the two [E1] was part of the design team and the other [E2] was completely unfamiliar with the visual design of ConToVi .",,,,

The second data source we used for the expert case study are the transcriptions of the televised US presidential election debates.,,,,
The main objective of these debates is to persuade yet undecided voters to vote for the party of the candidate.,,,,

[attitude],,,,
[ of a speaker towards a given topic?,,,,
"[Q7] How similar are movement, speech, and argumentation patterns of selected speakers?",,,,
These and other questions related to the dynamics of conversations inspired the two domain experts to come-up with relevant hypotheses for each of the use cases.,,,,
In the following Stuttgart 21 With respect to this arbitration the first hypothesis of E1 concerned the moderation style of the arbitrator Dr. Heiner Gei횩ler.,,,,
"Based on his previous knowledge about previous moderations, E1 expected that [H1] Dr. Gei횩ler is steering the conversation through an active moderation style and expected that he will be often part,icipa,ting in n,""on-moderational topics and thus contribute to the content of the conversation.,""",,,,
"To verify his hypothesis, E1 first watched the animation of V1 to track the movement of all speakers in the Topic-Space.",,,,
"By focusing on the movement of the moderator he could find different points in time where Dr. Gei횩ler changed the topic, followed by all active speakers.",,,,
"To verify his involvement in the topics, E1 then switched to V3.",,,,
"E1 found several large utterances associated with Dr. Gei횩ler in non-moderational topics, in addition to the small moderational utterances that were mainly clustered in a moderation topic.",,,,
Through this analysis E1 concluded that Dr. Gei횩ler indeed follows an active moderator role and thus verified his hypothesis.,,,,
"With respect to the three-fold categorization of mediation styles used in political science research, E1 could identify the arbitrator relying on the manipulative style?봞 mediation style that is ch,aract,erized by,""a high influence of the negotiation process, the content, and even the outcome.,""",,,,
"E1 appreciated the clarity of V1 which enabled him to focus on the conversation dynamics without distractions and enjoyed watching accumulation of utterances at the Topic-Space edges in V3, showing,the h,istory of,""the conversation while it evolved.,""",,,,
"E1 said that through identifying large topic segments that did not have many utterances attached to them, he could, in addition to knowing the past, predict the future of the conversation, since the,se se,gments ar,""e designed to contain a large number of utterances by the end of the animation.,""",,,,
"On the other hand, E2 was more interested in analyzing the collective behavior of all participants of the arbitration.",,,,
"Through her knowledge about the structure of this discussion, she expected that [H2] the debate starts with small focused discussions and presentation with a smaller number of speakers and then the,discu,ssion flo,""or is opened for a broader debate with all participants.,""",,,,
"Using V3, she was able to reconstruct the sequence of speakers and the discussed topics.",,,,
"While following along the animation, E2 could confirm her hypothesis, since the debate involved more speakers and a faster switching between topics towards the end of the discussion.",,,,
"Figure 1 displays one time-slice of this animation, where two speakers are moving in sequence.",,,,
"In addition to the behavior of single speakers, E2 was also interested in the behavior of speaker groups, i.e.",,,,
speakers that have the same position in the argumentation.,,,,
She expected [H3] that each group of participants would want to push their own topics.,,,,
This hypothesis contradicts one of the main assumptions of deliberation: to respect the positions and reasons of others and to allow an inclusive and intense debate.,,,,
"To analyze these dynamics, E2 colored all participants of a group in the same color and watched the accumulation of their utterances over time in V3.",,,,
"She concluded that while this claim could be partly true, she could not confirm it on this broader group level.",,,,
"However, by analyzing the individual speaker paths in V4, she was able to identify similarities and differences between speakers of the same or opposing parties, re- \x0cspectively.",,,,
"Figure 5 shows the paths of three speakers representing different positions in the arbitration: As the individual paths reveal, the arbitrator Dr. Gei횩ler addresses most topics, while both other sp,eaker,s only ad,""dress a subset of the topics.,""",,,,
"E2 was surprised to find D r. K efer a ddressing o nly s o f ew t opics, s ince s he expected him to be more deliberatively involved in the debate.",,,,
"With respect to deliberation and in particular the attitude of speakers, E1 and E2 could confirm their hypotheses that were derived from a qualitative inspection of the conversation.",,,,
"In general, E1 and E2 made extensive use of the sequence of speakers combining the overview with a detailed inspection of the content.",,,,
"For instance, they identified two strategies of the moderator Dr. Gei횩ler [H4] (see Figure 6): His utterances are characterized by linguistic particles establishing a common ground between the coun,terpa,""rts.,"",",,,,
"In each of his utterances, he indicates that the facts and propositions are already known to the opponents and expects the opponents to implicitly agree upon.",,,,
The moderator also consistently tries to achieve mutual consent by using particles demonstrating consensus willing.,,,,
Both experts were especially interested to see the reactions to the statements by the moderator that involved such particles.,,,,
"Consequently, they have found that this demonstrates the importance of an active moderator within the debate.",,,,
"For the other participants in the arbitration, similar patterns could be identified.",,,,
"US Presidential Debates For this study we presented the experts with three presidential election debates between President Obama and Governor Romney, concatenated.",,,,
"In contrast to S21, these debates have a clearer format with defined question and answer times.",,,,
Therefore the moderators are usually more passive.,,,,
"However, after watching the animated discussion overview V1, E1 suggested that [H5] the moderator might not only be passive, but unheard on several occasions.",,,,
He found various instances where the moderator attempts to change the topic and the two candidates just continue on talking.,,,,
He then commented that this is a common phenomenon in presidential debates when it comes to controversial topics.,,,,
"On the other hand, E2 was interested in the dynamics between participants.",,,,
"She noticed that [H6] throughout the debate, Obama takes a defensive role in contrast to Romney, who appears to be more offensive.",,,,
"This finding i s b ased o n t he t opic g lyphs i n V2, where she noticed that Romney is actively introducing new topics, while Obama addresses these topics afterwards.",,,,
"She first thought this is due to the speaker turns in the debate, but as this became a notifiable t rend t hroughout t he d iscussion, s he s tarted a m ore detailed analysis using V3.",,,,
"By following the sequence of utterances in each topic and differentiating between utterances of different speakers, E2 concluded that Romney indeed has more instances of first-topic-switches than Ob,ama.,"","",",,,,
These subjective findings were confirmed through a text-level analysis of relevant utterances.,,,,
Overall Feedback The political science scholars were very eager to explore the discussions and debates using the interactive Topic-Space views of ConToVi.,,,,
"Expert E2, who was unfamiliar with the system, analyzed the debates within the same amount of time than E1.",,,,
Both experts were interested in exploring the conversation in the multiple levels of detail provided by the tool and appreciated the ability to dig deeper for more information during the analysis.,,,,
"The power of the visual representation and abstraction of the datasets allowed the analysts to get a new perspective of the c conversations and, through focusing on the relevant aspects, to find new,patt,erns and,""outliers, even in the discussions they were already familiar with.,""",,,,
"Moreover, the overlay of the topic and argumentation glyphs was perceived as particularly helpful to understand the positioning of points in the space and to identify speech and argumentation patter,ns fo,r differe,""nt speakers.,""",,,,
Both experts agreed that the use of ConToVi has an added value to their research on deliberation and they see potential for future applications.,,,,

"Conclusion and Future Work We presented ConToVi, a novel visual analytics approach for multiparty conversation exploration that assists political science scholars to identify deliberative patterns d,ebate,""s.,"",",,,,
"We introduce the concept of a Topic-Space, relying on the metaphor of a discussion floor.",,,,
"In an observational study, we derived six important requirements [R1-R6] for the analysis of conversations and addressed these by designing four different views [V1-V4] for the Topic-Space.",,,,
"The main contributions [C1-C6] of our work provide a coherent visualization solution to a radial layout of topic-dimensions and propose measures to overcome the drawbacks that might occur with this,layou,t strateg,""y.,""",,,,
"We evaluate our approach using two real-world political debates and through an expert case study, we demonstrated the use of ConToVi to verify the hypotheses [H1-H8] of two political science scholar,""s.,"",,",,,,
"Furthermore, ConToVi can be used to analyze any kind of conversational text data; it is not restricted to the use of oral communication, but can also be applied to online forum discussions or chats.,"","",,",,,,
"With the exception of the specific language features for the speech and argumentation analysis, ConToVi is language independent and can be used to analyze debates in any language.",,,,
"Hence, ConToVi provides a generic framework to for the analysis of dynamics in multi-party conversations.",,,,
Our approach has been well received and has been found to be intuitive and understandable.,,,,
"The users of the tool appreciated the consistency in the usage of the visual metaphor, which helped them create a mental model of conversations that it tightly coupled with the visualizations of Con,ToVi.,"","",",,,,
"However, the visualization has also some limitations.",,,,
"The main open task for the visual design is to expand the detail provided in the topic labels and optimize their placement, which is part of our future work.",,,,
"Moreover, the navigation through time will be also supported by directly moving the speaker points in the overview visualization, similar to the direct interactions in DimpVis [KC14].",,,,

Visualizing Social Media Content with SentenTree Fig.,,,,
"1: Part of a SentenTree visualization of a collection of 189,450 tweets (108,702 unique) posted in a 15 minute time window around the first goal of the opening game of the 2014 Soccer World Cup.",,,,
"Abstract?봚e introduce SentenTree, a novel technique for visualizing the content of unstructured social media text.",,,,
SentenTree displays frequent sentence patterns abstracted from a corpus of social media posts.,,,,
"The technique employs design ideas from word clouds and the Word Tree, but overcomes a number of limitations of both those visualizations.",,,,
SentenTree displays a node-link diagram where nodes are words and links indicate word co-occurrence within the same sentence.,,,,
The spatial arrangement of nodes gives cues to the syntactic ordering of words while the size of nodes gives cues to their frequency of occurrence.,,,,
SentenTree can help people gain a rapid understanding of key concepts and opinions in a large social media text collection.,,,,
It is implemented as a lightweight application that runs in the browser.,,,,
"Index Terms?봳ext visualization, social media, natural language processing, word cloud, Twitter 1 I NTRODUCTION With the popularity of social media and online communities, a new type of text documen,t is,growing e,""xplosively.,""",,,,
"Examples of these documents include Tweets, Facebook posts, YouTube comments, and Yelp reviews that we will collectively call social media text.",,,,
Social media text encodes rich information on the public's interests and opinions and this information is valuable to both professional analysts and casual users.,,,,
"While we can gain valuable information from examining the social network structure and the message volume fluctuations, making sense of the textual content itself remains very challenging.",,,,
"Due to the natural complexities of human languages, unstructured text does not lend itself well to computational analysis.",,,,
"Social media text further complicates the problem with its unique qualities?봀ompared to traditional text documents (e.g. book chapters, news articles) a social media text collection typically conta,ins a,large nu,""mber of very short documents authored by different users.,""",,,,
"For a given topic, we can accumulate a huge document collection in a very short period of time that contains highly repetitive and redundant information.",,,,
"Keeping these challenges in mind, we focus on a simple goal in this paper: designing a visualization technique that helps people gain a quick overview of the content of a social media text collectio,""n.,"",,",,,,
There are typically two ways to provide a high-level summary of a text document set.,,,,
One solution is to extract a few representative sentences from the collection.,,,,
"For social media messages, this can be accomplished by showing the documents with the most shares or ?쐄avorite??designations.",,,,
"This popularity-based solution works well for some situations, but it runs a risk of lacking coverage.",,,,
"Research shows that the most popular messages on social media are usually produced by a small population of elite users or opinion leaders [19, 42].",,,,
"Therefore, selecting the most popular messages usually means overlooking the voices of ?쐎rdinary??users of social media.",,,,
"In many scenarios, the opinions of ordinary people are precisely what the analyst wants to hear.",,,,
A second solution that takes coverage into consideration is to extract some common information from the entire document collection.,,,,
"Numerous research efforts in the text mining community employ advanced rule-based and statistical methods (e.g., entity identification, topic modeling) to produce representative word lists or distri,butio,ns and do,""cument clusters.,""",,,,
The presentation of these outputs is almost inevitably some variation of a word cloud.,,,,
"While it makes sense to present topics using words, we argue that word clouds only give a sense of concepts, not more developed thoughts or opinions.",,,,
"Longer, connected phrases and sentences provide people with more complete ideas, thoughts, and sentiments of the document authors.",,,,
A number of attempts to add more context or structure to wordbased visualizations exist.,,,,
"One general approach is the use of semanticpreserving word clouds [11, 31, 38, 44].",,,,
"Another is to connect words through visual structures such as lines [9, 22, 26].",,,,
"Yet another approach, including systems such as Word Tree [39], Phrase Net [35], and Wordgraph [32], positions and links words spatially following their natural occurrences in sentences, thus better,enco,ding thou,""ghts and opinions.,""",,,,
These projects inspire our design of a novel visualization technique for summarizing text.,,,,
"We introduce the SentenTree, a novel technique for visualizing the content of unstructured social media text.",,,,
SentenTree seeks a balance between showing the most frequent words and preserving sentence structure.,,,,
"SentenTree gives people a high-level overview of the most common expressions in a document collection, and allows drilling down to details through interactions.",,,,
2 R ELATED W ORK Visualization has been applied to text documents of varying sizes for many different tasks [25].,,,,
Some projects facilitate the understanding of very large document sets by focusing on extracting the key themes and concepts and clustering documents according to these themes and concepts.,,,,
Visualizations often map concepts and documents to a 2D/2.5D space and utilize spatial proximity to imply relationships between concepts and documents.,,,,
"Examples of this type of visualizations include \x0cSPIRE/IN-SPIRE [41], the Stanford Dissertation Browser [7], and many knowledge mapping visualizations [3].",,,,
"Complex clustering and language modeling techniques are often used to extract concepts and relationships, and the goal of these types of visualizations is understanding the landscape of documents be,yond,just lear,""ning about the content of the documents.,""",,,,
Another type of text visualization facilitates understanding of documents and insight generation by linking named entities.,,,,
"Jigsaw [16] is a system for investigative analysis that focuses on entity co-occurrence within the same document, while FacetAtlas [5] looks for complex multifaceted entity relationships.",,,,
Many text visualizations attempt to portray temporal changes of topics.,,,,
The STREAMIT system [1] shows an evolving document collection as small circles that are clustered together to denote similarity.,,,,
"A popular visual metaphor used for portraying tempral changes is the streamgraph, as exemplified by ThemeRiver [17] that uses this technique to encode topic volume changes over time.",,,,
"MemeTracker [27], TIARA [40], TextFlow [10], and OpinionFlow [43] are just a few of the many visualizations using some variation of the ThemeRiver technique.",,,,
Some of these systems overlay a word cloud on the ThemeRiver to display textual content.,,,,
"EventRiver [29], Leadline [14], Cloudlines [23], and Xu's system [45] use bubble-like visual elements to show event bursts detected from text streams.",,,,
"Another technique, employed by Story Tracker [24], clusters news stories and displays a set of keywords for each news story at a different time point.",,,,
The keywords are linked over time by edges.,,,,
Other text visualizations map topics/concepts to physical locations.,,,,
Scatterblogs [4] is an example system that generates keywords from social media text and overlays them on a map to show the origins of the text.,,,,
Another system [28] combines a map view with word cloud and time series views to show how specific events have framed topic changes in document collections.,,,,
"All of these visualizations seek to highlight concept relationships, topical changes, or physical locations in the visualization, and the textual content is either hidden or displayed primarily by a,word,cloud va,""riation.,""",,,,
Visualizations of the actual textual content are less common.,,,,
In the next two sections we review two major classes of visualizations of textual content: word cloud-related visualizations and text structure visualizations.,,,,
2.1 Word cloud related visualizations Tag clouds or word clouds are arguably the most widely used visualization method to display the content of text documents.,,,,
"Popularized by numerous websites, the original tag clouds visualizations show frequently used tags and vary font size according to tag usage frequency [36].",,,,
"As people started to apply the visualization technique to other text documents, the name ?쐗ord cloud??and sometimes ?쐔ext cloud??grew in popularity.",,,,
We will use ?쐗ord cloud??to refer to this visualization technique hereafter.,,,,
"A major variation on word clouds, the Wordle technique [37], automatically generates compact and aesthetically pleasing layouts with words at varying orientations.",,,,
Chuang et al. [6] applied natural language processing techniques to improve word selection.,,,,
"Word clouds are also often added to other visual metaphors, as we discussed above, to provide some context to the textual content.",,,,
"Despite their popularity, word clouds have been found to be lacking for analytical tasks [36].",,,,
"Hearst and Rosner [18] pointed out three major problems with word clouds: 1) the size encoding is not accurate due to different word length, which makes it hard to compare words, 2) the physical lay,out i,s not mea,""ningful, therefore words appear in discrete form and there's no context next to them, and 3) there is no natural ?쐄low??for reading, the viewer just looks at random words in the visualization.,""",,,,
"Supporting the final two points, Yatani et al. found that humans tend to verbalize opinions in short expressions rather than discrete words [46].",,,,
"One collection of projects, semantic-preserving word clouds, primarily address the second problem above by positioning words/terms closely to other related ones.",,,,
"Context-preserving word clouds [11], Seam-carving word clouds [44], ProjCloud [31], and ReCloud [38] all pursue this approach in different ways.",,,,
"In general, they focus on clustering related words together and providing compact visual representations of the word collections.",,,,
Barth et al. [2] introduce three additional semantic word cloud algorithms and compare them to some of the other existing algorithms along various quantitative metrics.,,,,
WordWanderer [13] allows a viewer to select or compare words in a cloud and then the position and appearance of other words changes to reflect the selection.,,,,
All these techniques position words based on some measure of similarity or relatedness.,,,,
"SentenTree, conversely, uses actual sentence structures from the document collection to position words and terms, thus making it more like the systems discussed in the next section than the above te,chniq,""ues.,"",",,,,
Another collection of projects extends word clouds by introducing graphical structures onto the word collections.,,,,
Parallel Tag Clouds [9] shows connections between words in multiple tag clouds using a parallel coordinates style visualization.,,,,
"SparkClouds [26] does something similar, but uses sparklines as the organizing visual metaphor.",,,,
WordBridge [22] shows clusters of words connected by lines and other ?쐀ridging??words that connect terms in different clusters.,,,,
"Our SentenTree technique similarly seeks to position and connect words using link structures, but they are derived from word positions in sentences.",,,,
2.2 Visualizations of text structures Researchers have suggested other visualization techniques for textual content that preserve some of the original text and sentence structures.,,,,
"A notable example is the Word Tree [39], which allows a person to select a word of interest and displays the sentence segments next to that word by building and visualizing a prefix tree with the se,lecte,d word at,""the root.,""",,,,
The viewer thus learns about the word in the context of sentences.,,,,
Double Tree [12] extends this technique by building Word Trees on both sides of the word of interest.,,,,
Wordgraph [32] allows query by wildcard and displays not only Word Trees on both sides of the query pattern but also branches in between query terms.,,,,
These techniques were a major source of inspiration to the design of SentenTree because we also seek to show words in the context of sentences.,,,,
"However, we do not want to require a person to select specific words to act as the foci of the visualization.",,,,
"Instead, we want the initial visualization to appear simply given a collection of documents.",,,,
"The PhraseNet [35] visualization technique identifies word pair relationships (e.g., X and Y, X of Y, X's Y) in a document and displays those pairs in a node-link network.",,,,
"Although applied for a different purpose, showing uncertainty in statistically-derived lattice structures, the layout algorithm by Collins et al. [8] attempts to position words to reflect sentence s,truct,ures with,""a goal similar to ours.,""",,,,
It positions words from a sentence horizontally with potential replacement words drawn above others.,,,,
We also have been inspired by several infographics found online.,,,,
"One ?쐅enre??of these use flowchart-style graphs to show the sequential order and repetitions of words in items such as song lyrics and stories, as exemplified by a comic from xkcd [30].",,,,
"3 S ENTEN T REE D ESIGN Figure 1 shows an example of the SentenTree visualization for a Twitter dataset of 189,450 tweets commenting on the opening game of the 2014 Soccer World Cup, posted during a,15 m,inute tim,""e window around the first goal.,""",,,,
"A person looking at this visualization will immediately notice some prominent words like first, goal, world cup, watching, etc.",,,,
"Similar to a text cloud, the large font size of these words indicates their high frequency of occurrence in the dataset.",,,,
These words are good indications that people were discussing the game between Brazil and Croatia.,,,,
An edge between two words indicates their occurrence in the same tweet.,,,,
"By interacting with the visualization and following the linked words from left to right, the viewer can further identify patterns such as first goal world cup own goal.",,,,
"Hovering the cursor over the word own (Figure 2a), highlights the expression first goal world cup own goal, fades other words, and displays example tweets containing these words in that order.",,,,
"Hovering over the word score (Figure 2b), highlights another expression: brazil marcelo score first goal world cup brazil.",,,,
These actions should help the viewer learn that the first goal of \x0cthe World Cup was an accidental own goal by Brazilian player Marcelo against his own team.,,,,
3.1 Design Goals In this section we discuss four goals that drove the design of SentenTree.,,,,
"The first design goal was to leverage the positive qualities of word clouds, namely their ability to facilitate fast impressions by utilizing size.",,,,
"Since the most frequent words are encoded in the largest font sizes, they jump out to the viewer.",,,,
"In the SentenTree visualization, we also wanted the frequent words and expressions to be displayed more prominently so they can be easily spotted by the viewer.",,,,
The second goal was to bring in more sentence structure from the items in the text collection.,,,,
"As researchers have repeatedly found, a bag of discrete words is limited in its expressiveness.",,,,
"Other approaches, such as the Word Tree [39], give context to a word through displaying sentence fragments next to that word.",,,,
"Review Spotlight [46] uses adjective-noun pairs to summarize opinions, which turned out to be much more informative than text clouds for the same data.",,,,
"For SentenTree, we use fragments extracted from sentences to represent those sentences.",,,,
"For example, a person should be able to reasonably guess the meaning of first goal world cup own goal without reading the full sentence the first goal of the World Cup is an own goal.",,,,
"These fragments are called frequent sequential patterns, and we will more formally define them in the next section.",,,,
We chose to use patterns instead of full sentences because of a third design goal: the visualization should be concise but yet cover as much of the dataset as possible.,,,,
A concise pattern may summarize many sentences that are similar to each other but have slight differences.,,,,
"For example, in the previous example, the pattern first goal world cup own goal is shared by 14,935 tweets (Figure 2a) and the pattern score first goal world cup is shared by 13,330 tweets (Figure 2,""b).,"",,",,,,
"Frequent sequential patterns are especially well suited to social media text because social media text collections on a given topic typically contain many sentences that share similar structures wit,h sma,ll wordin,""g differences.,""",,,,
The conciseness goal also suggests that we cannot show all frequent sequential patterns.,,,,
"Thus, the SentenTree technique collapses common parts of patterns to both save space and highlight their commonality.",,,,
A reader familiar with the Word Tree might have noticed the similarity between Figure 1 and a Word Tree in that some large words have several branches extending from them on one or both sides.,,,,
This is an indication that these big words are shared by several different sequential patterns.,,,,
"Since our objective is to provide a high-level overview of the textual content, SentenTree follows the Shneiderman Mantra to provide an ?쐎verview first?? then allow ?쐚oom and filter??to get to ?쐂,etail,s on dema,""nd??[34].,""",,,,
"By starting with the most common patterns, SentenTree addresses the entry point problem of the Word Tree [39]: instead of relying on people to identify their own entry point, the technique provides,them,with an o,""verview of the most frequent patterns and allows them to select patterns of interest and drill down to see more details.,""",,,,
This implies a fourth design goal on the technique: the pattern generation algorithm needs to be incremental.,,,,
3.2 The set of sentences containing the sequence 慣 form the support database D慣 .,,,,
The support of 慣 is the number of sentences in D. A sequence 慣 is called a frequent sequential pattern when support of 慣 exceeds some predefined lower threshold.,,,,
"In data mining, the threshold is called a minimum support threshold and is generally fixed for each mining task.",,,,
"In our case, the minimum support threshold is not fixed because we want to build frequent sequential patterns incrementally.",,,,
"For example, suppose we have a database consisting of three sentences (sequences) s1 : The first goal of the World Cup is an own goal, s2 : Someone somewhere has made a lot of money on first goal of,Worl,d Cup bei,""ng an own goal and s3 : Brazil's Marcelo scored the first goal of the World Cup.,""",,,,
"The support of the sequence first goal world cup is 3 as it is a subsequence of all three sequences in the database, while the support of the sequence first goal world cup own goal is 2 because it i,s a s,ubsequenc,""e of s1 and s2 but not s3 .,""",,,,
"If the minimum support threshold is 3, then only first goal world cup is considered a frequent sequential pattern.",,,,
"But if the minimum support threshold is 2, then both sequences are considered frequent sequential patterns.",,,,
"Frequent Sequential Patterns As discussed in the previous section, the central idea behind SentenTree is to take a large social media dataset, find the most frequent sequences of words, and build a,visua,lization,""out from them.,""",,,,
The sequences are called frequent sequential patterns.,,,,
"Below, we define the concept and then describe the sequence generation algorithm in detail.",,,,
"Because of the complexity of the algorithm, the following section provides an example to help explain its operations.",,,,
"First, we formally define frequent sequential patterns for social media text based on a more general concept from data mining [33].",,,,
We consider a sentence a sequence of words.,,,,
Suppose we have two sequences 慣 =< a1 a2 .,,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
"an >, 棺 =< b1 b2 .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
"bm > where a1 , a2 , .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
", an , b1 , b2 , .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
", bm are words.",,,,
"We say that 慣 is a subsequence of 棺 , and 棺 is a super-sequence of 慣, if there exist integers 1 ??j1 < j2 < .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
"< jn ??m such that a1 = b j1 , a2 = b j2 , .",,,,
.,,,,
.,,,,
", an = b jn .",,,,
This is denoted as 慣 ??棺 .,,,,
3.2.1 Sequential pattern generation and graph building algorithm Algorithm 1 shows the process for constructing the graph data structure for the first time.,,,,
The system first takes in raw sentences and goes through an initialization process (initialization()).,,,,
"This process normalizes sentences to lower case, performs tokenization to segment \x0csentences into words (including numbers, hashtags, urls, etc.",,,,
"), and filters out stop words.",,,,
"Then an initial pattern is created without any words, and all tokenized sentences are put into its support database.",,,,
"This initial pattern serves as the root node of a tree of sequential patterns, which we use to store intermediate states of the sequential pattern generation process.",,,,
This tree is important because we can reuse these intermediate states when zooming in and out on the visualization.,,,,
Then the algorithm calls the patternGeneration() function to grow new sequential patterns from the root one.,,,,
"The task of patternGeneration() (Algorithm 2) is to start with a given sequential pattern and grow its super-sequences until the total number of words in the patterns reaches the given number of vis,ible,words nee,""ded.,""",,,,
These patterns will appear in the visualization and the given number of visible words needed is determined by the screen size (typically 100-200).,,,,
The algorithm grows patterns by maintaining a list of leaf sequential patterns.,,,,
"At first, the only item in the list is the given sequential pattern.",,,,
"In every run, the most frequent pattern is popped from the leaf pattern list, and the program finds its most frequent supersequence which is one word longer than the old pattern.",,,,
This means a new word will be added to the visualization and the number of visible words needed is reduced by one.,,,,
"The new sequential pattern becomes the left child of the old sequential pattern on the tree, and a pattern that looks exactly like the old one is added as the right child of the old sequential patte,""rn.,"",,",,,,
"The support database of the old pattern is split between the new patterns, and the new patterns are added to the list of leaf patterns.",,,,
"Therefore, at anytime, the original database is split between the support databases of all the leaf patterns.",,,,
The program continues growing new leaf patterns until the number of visible words needed is reduced to zero.,,,,
"Function patternGeneration() returns the list of leaf patterns to function graphCreation(), which uses these leaf patterns to construct a graph data structure for the visualization.",,,,
"In the graph data structure, each node is a word in the sequences; a word shared by multiple leaf patterns appears as one node.",,,,
A directed edge is added between every pair of adjacent words in a leaf pattern.,,,,
"After the visualization is created, the user may wish to zoom in on a frequent sequential pattern and bring up more children patterns.",,,,
"In this case, the program calls patternGeneration() with the selected sequential pattern as the start pattern and starts growing new patterns from there.",,,,
The algorithm is usually able to reuse some patterns from the sequential patterns tree so it does not have to recalculate patterns that were discovered before.,,,,
"When the leaf patterns are returned, the program constructs a new graph from the leaf sequential patterns in the same way described in the previous paragraph.",,,,
Note the goal of this algorithm is different from a typical sequential pattern mining algorithm.,,,,
"Instead of trying to find all frequent sequential patterns based on a minimum support threshold, this algorithm only grows sequential patterns from existing patterns for building the graph visualiza,tion.,"","",",,,,
Most algorithms in sequential pattern mining follow a depth-first approach to find sequential patterns because they want to enumerate all patterns satisfying a lower limit frequency.,,,,
"Our approach is breadth-first, and will take more time to perform than the depth-first approach if our goal is to exhaust all possible patterns.",,,,
"However, we only need a limited number of patterns each time due to display limits, therefore the breadth-first approach works well for its incremental quality.",,,,
3.2.2 Example - World Cup First Goal We use a simplified World Cup example to illustrate our approach.,,,,
Figure 3 illustrates the following steps.,,,,
"We start with a dataset of 189,450 tweets.",,,,
"We first normalize the tweets to lower case, perform tokenization to segment each tweet into discrete words (including hashtags, urls, etc.)",,,,
and remove stop words and punctuation.,,,,
1,,,,
We find the most frequent single word pattern (i.e.,,,,
"the most frequent word) in the dataset to be goal, and divide the dataset into tweets containing goal (74,554) and tweets without goal (114,896).",,,,
"leaf patterns: empty pattern (114,896), goal (74,554) 2.",,,,
"Next we pick the most frequent leaf pattern which is the empty pattern with 114,896 tweets.",,,,
"We find the most frequent single word pattern within these tweets to be watching (11,248) and add it to the tree, we also end up with an empty pattern with a support of 103,648. leaf patterns: empty,patt,""ern (103,"",""648), goal (74,554), watching (11,248) 3.,""",,,,
The most frequent leaf pattern is still the empty pattern.,,,,
For illustration purpose we will ignore it from now on and pick the pattern goal.,,,,
We will grow our pattern by one by finding the next most frequent pattern in the subset of tweets containing goal.,,,,
"The new sequential pattern is first goal (41,344).",,,,
"Note that the new pattern will always contain the previous pattern, as all tweets in this subset contain the previous pattern.",,,,
"We also end up with a pattern goal without a first before it and this subset has 33,210 tweets.",,,,
"leaf patterns: first goal (41,344), goal (33,210), watching (11,248) 4.",,,,
The most frequent pattern is first goal.,,,,
Create first goal world.,,,,
"leaf patterns: first goal world (36,136), goal (33,210), watching (11,248), first goal (5,208) 5.",,,,
The most frequent pattern is first goal world.,,,,
Create first goal world cup.,,,,
"leaf patterns: first goal world cup (36,081), goal (33,210), watching (11,248), first goal (5,208), first goal world (55) 6.",,,,
The most frequent pattern is first goal world cup.,,,,
Create first goal world cup own.,,,,
"leaf patterns: goal (33,210), first goal world up (21,220), first goal world cup own (14,861), watching (11,248), first goal (5,208), first goal world (55) 7.",,,,
"The most frequent pattern is goal (33,210).",,,,
Create own goal.,,,,
Note that in this new pattern own goal we have a word own and in a previously generated pattern first goal world cup own we also have a word own.,,,,
But these two words are not considered common branches in the SentenTree and will be represented by two distinct nodes in the final visualization.,,,,
"leaf patterns: first goal world cup (21,220), goal (19,977), first goal world cup own (14,861), own goal (13,233), watching (11,248), first goal (5,208), first goal world (55) 8.",,,,
The most frequent pattern is first goal world cup.,,,,
Create score first goal world cup.,,,,
"Note that each time we grow a new pattern, a word is added to the existing pattern.",,,,
"The new word can appear before, behind or in-between the words of the parent pattern.",,,,
"leaf patterns: goal (19,977), first goal world cup own (14,861), score first goal world cup (13,291), own goal (13,233), watching (11,248), first goal world cup (7,929), first goal (5,208), first go,al wo,rld (55),""The leaf patterns first goal world cup own, score first goal world cup, own goal, and watching are used to construct a graph structure for the final visualization (Figure 4).,""",,,,
"Note that first goal world cup own and score first goal world cup share a subsequence first goal world cup, and this subsequence also shares the word goal with own goal.",,,,
While watching is not connected to the other words and forms its own graph.,,,,
We will discuss the layout and visual encodings of the graph in the next section.,,,,
The different sequential patterns can be highlighted by hovering the mouse over one of the words.,,,,
We will discuss the interactions in detail in section 3.4.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
3: An example pattern generation process.,,,,
The words in boldface are new words added to the parent pattern to generate the current pattern.,,,,
The numbers in parenthesis are the support of each sequential pattern.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
4: A simple SentenTree of top sequential patterns in the World Cup dataset.,,,,
"3.2.3 Additional Considerations ?쏝ig words??As described in previous sections, SentenTree prioritizes the most frequent sequential patterns and grows new patterns out of the existing ones.",,,,
This introduces a problem in some scenarios: a large pattern may dominate the view and prevent other interesting patterns from surfacing.,,,,
"This is especially likely to happen when the dataset is retrieved based on particular keywords, therefore those keywords exist in most entries in the dataset.",,,,
"Since the person using the system is already familiar with the keywords, we suspect they are not crucial to the view.",,,,
"Additionally, their large size and visual dominance may obscure useful new information.",,,,
Figure 5 shows what happens with the World Cup dataset used in the teaser image (Figure 1) without deprioritizing world cup.,,,,
Note how world cup is huge and makes many branches small and difficult to read.,,,,
"Only one graph is in the view, so it generates significant white space, compared to Figure 1, where multiple graphs fill up the screen.",,,,
We address this problem by imposing a rule that words that appear in a large of number entries cannot be used to generate the first pattern of a graph.,,,,
"After testing a variety of values, we set the cut-off to be one third of the database size.",,,,
This rule ensures that the view never ends up with a huge pattern that is significantly larger than the rest of its branches.,,,,
"These patterns will still show up in the visualization, but they will appear in multiple graphs so each one is smaller and does not skew the other words.",,,,
Fig.,,,,
5: A SentenTree visualization of the same dataset as Figure 1 without deprioritizing world cup.,,,,
Tokenization and filtering Tokenization segments sentences into words.,,,,
"Our implementation employs a regular expression pattern to match not only words but also numbers, hashtags, urls, @ handles, etc., because they are prevalent in social media text.",,,,
"The current implementation of SentenTree does not perform stemming; therefore, words like watch and watching are considered different tokens.",,,,
We are considering including a stemmer for future versions of SentenTree.,,,,
The SentenTree algorithm does not include punctuation as tokens.,,,,
"Additionally, it discards stop words such as ?쐔he?? ?쏿nd?? ?쐎f?? etc 1 .",,,,
"These choices are opposite as done in the Word Tree, which keeps both stop words and punctuation to best preserve the context for each word.",,,,
We decided to remove stop words and punctuation because SentenTree is a high-level summary of the text.,,,,
Stop words and punctuation are not likely to be as informative as substantive words in the dataset.,,,,
"Furthermore, common stop words and punctuation may ?쐗ash out??the more important content words.",,,,
Note that negation words like ?쐍ot??are not considered stop words because taking them out would reverse the meaning of sentences.,,,,
"Currently the algorithm does not filter out hashtags or urls, but we have noticed that in general they are less informative than regular words and may be a waste of screen real estate, so we plan to,incl,ude optio,""ns to filter them out in the future.,""",,,,
3.3 Spatial layout and visual encodings We produce a visualization from the graph structure generated in the previous section.,,,,
The graph visualization is created through a forcedirected approach.,,,,
Each graph is its own SVG element so that the layout algorithm can run in parallel for multiple disconnected graphs.,,,,
The SVG elements are ordered by the frequency of the largest word in the graph and packed as tightly as possible on the screen.,,,,
We developed alignment constraints for the force-directed layout and enforce them using the CoLa package [15].,,,,
"The most basic constraint is the word order constraint: if two words appear in the same sequential pattern, the relative horizontal placement of words must follow their natural order in the pattern.,"","",,",,,,
This promotes that a person can read a pattern from left to right and understand its meaning.,,,,
"By experimenting with initial layouts, we further developed vertical and horizontal constraints that increase the legibility of the graph: vertical: If two words always appear as a bigram, then we s,horte,n the lin,""k between the two words and make sure they always appear on \x0cthe same vertical level.,""",,,,
"An example is the words world and cup in Figure 1. horizontal: If two patterns share some a common subpattern, then the words of the same distance from the common subpattern should center horizontal,""ly.,"",,",,,,
"An example is Figure 6b where the words way, buys, picks, etc.",,,,
are centered horizontally because they all appear next to yelp.,,,,
"These constraints not only make the graph layout less cluttered, but they also impose structure on the layout so that words in similar syntactic positions align vertically and can be compared agains,t eac,h other.,"",""",,,,
The power of these layout constraints is demonstrated in Figure 6.,,,,
This dataset consists of tweets mentioning the food ordering service Eat24 shortly after it was acquired by Yelp.,,,,
(Only part of the visualization is shown in Figure 6.),,,,
"Figure 6a shows the result of running the force-directed layout without the horizontal and vertical constraints, and Figure 6b shows the result with the constraints.",,,,
"Note that alignment yields useful information: the observer can see that when people discuss the acquisition, they use many sentences that are similar in form and meaning but vary slightly in wordin,""g.,"",,",,,,
"For example, they use picks and gobbles in place of buys, and describe Eat24 as food ordering service or delivery network.",,,,
We address this problem by using interaction.,,,,
A person can hover the mouse over a word and all other words besides those that appear in its sequential pattern will become semi-transparent.,,,,
The highlighted sequential pattern is the most frequent ?쐋eaf pattern??containing the selected word.,,,,
(A ?쐋eaf??pattern is a pattern without a longer supersequence on the screen.),,,,
Most words in the leaf pattern are colored in light blue but the words that appear as many or more times than the selected word are colored in dark blue.,,,,
"These words form the most frequent pattern containing the selected word, and a tooltip pops up showing the frequency of this pattern.",,,,
"When a person hovers the mouse over a word, the system also displays the most common example sentences (e.g., Tweets) containing it in the lower left of the window, as shown in Figure 2.",,,,
This helps the viewer learn more about precise thoughts and opinions in the text.,,,,
We also enable drilling down to an existing sequential pattern to see more details.,,,,
"When a person clicks on a word, SentenTree zooms in to the most frequent pattern containing the selected work (the pattern is colored in dark blue) and filters out all other sequential patterns.",,,,
SentenTree also grows the current sequential pattern to include new words.,,,,
An example is Figure 8a.,,,,
The viewer clicks on penalty and all other branches disappear.,,,,
The branch with penalty in the center grows out to fill the screen.,,,,
The viewer can click on a RESET button in the interface (not shown in the figure) to go back to the full view.,,,,
3.5 Implementation and performance We have implemented the SentenTree algorithm in Javascript for the web.,,,,
"In this implementation, a person provides raw text (e.g., tweets) to the application.",,,,
All following computations are performed in the browser on the client side.,,,,
We use d3.js2 for the visualization and cola.js3 for the constraint-based force-directed layout.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
6: Part of a SentenTree visualizations of tweets discussing Yelp's acquisition of Eat24.,,,,
We use font size and color shading to double-encode the frequency of occurrence.,,,,
We make the font size of a word proportional to the square root of the number of text documents containing the sequential pattern where the word first arises.,,,,
"Using the simplified World Cup example from the previous section, the size of goal is proportional to the square root of the number of tweets containing the pattern goal, while the size of cup is de,termi,ned by th,""e square root of the number of tweets containing the pattern first goal world cup.,""",,,,
More frequent words are in a darker shade of blue than less frequent words.,,,,
We also made it optional to turn the first and last word in a pattern to purple in order to distinguish the beginning and ending of patterns.,,,,
Some of the use cases in this paper have that option turned on.,,,,
"We are considering other options for word color, such as encoding the sentiment of words, but the benefit provided by such a change must be weighed carefully against the visual variation and inconsi,stenc,y it intr,""oduces.,""",,,,
"We also experimented with varying the width and shade of the edges but found that this introduces more visual clutter than useful information, so we decided to render the edges as thin light-gray cu,rves.,"","",",,,,
"3.4 Interactions Since we are placing sequential patterns in a graph, a problem arises in that people viewing the visualization often cannot tell where a sequence starts and where it ends.",,,,
"As shown in Figure 4, someone viewing this visualization might assume a pattern score first goal world cup own exists, but in reality the dataset only contains score first goal world cup and first g,oal w,orld cup,""own which are connected by the common part in-between.,""",,,,
This problem is also present in Double Tree (Word Tree on both sides) [12] and Wordgraph [32].,,,,
"The pipeline of SentenTree can be broken into three steps: 1) load and preprocess (e.g. tokenize) the input data, 2) extract frequent sequential patterns and construct the graph data structure, 3) v,isual,ize the g,""raphs on the screen.,""",,,,
"When a user interacts with the view by drilling down to show more details, we repeat steps 2 and 3, though the patterns generated from a prior step 2 can be reused.",,,,
The runtime of step 1 is linear to the total number of words in the dataset.,,,,
"Because the number of words in a sentence (or other social media text unit such as a Tweet) is limited, the runtime of step 1 is roughly linear to the number of sentences in the dataset.",,,,
The runtime of step 2 is linear to the product of the number of sentences and the number of words in the final visualization.,,,,
"Because we limit the number of words shown due to available screen space, the runtime of step 2 is also roughly linear to the number of sentences in the dataset.",,,,
"The runtime of step 3 is more difficult to estimate, because the constraint-based force-directed layout is influenced both by the number of words and edges in the graph as well as the complexity of,the g,""raph.,"",",,,,
"The layout algorithm runs in parallel for multiple disconnected graphs, so the time consumed is dependent on the largest, most complicated graph.",,,,
"We tested the technique on datasets with 10,000 (10K), 100,000 (100K), and 1,000,000 (1M) unique sentences in a Google Chrome Browser on a MacBook Air laptop.",,,,
The number of words shown in the visualization was fixed at 150.,,,,
"For the 10k datasets, step 1 took 0.25 to 0.45 seconds, and step 2 took 0.8 to 2 seconds.",,,,
"For the 100k datasets, step 1 took under 3.1 seconds, and step 2 took 11 to 17.5 seconds.",,,,
"For the 1M datasets, step 1 took under 30 seconds, and step 2 took under 1 minute.",,,,
"The runtime for step 3 is not related to the input data size, but is dependent on the most complicated graph in the visualization.",,,,
"For all of the datasets we tested, the most time-consuming graph layout took under 6 seconds, though we observed that layout started to stabilize after the first half second and only made minor move,ments,afterwar,""ds.,""",,,,
"Thus, the effective total duration to display each of the three sizes of data was about 2 seconds, 20 seconds, and 2 minutes.",,,,

"4 4.1 E XAMPLE U SE C ASES A typical exploration scenario - World Cup In this section, we describe a use case of exploring comments on an event through SentenTree visualizations.",,,,
Suppose a person wishes to learn about Twitter users??reactions to the opening game of the 2014 Soccer World Cup between Brazil and Croatia.,,,,
"The person already knows that multiple goals were scored during the game, each creating a huge spike in tweet volume.",,,,
"For each goal, the person is able to obtain 15 minutes of relevant tweets using keywords and hashtags like ?쐗orld cup?? ??worldcup2014?? ??bravscro?? ??bra?? ??cro?? etc.",,,,
We describe how she explores the tweets for the first three goals of the game.,,,,
First Goal The SentenTree visualization for the first goal is presented in Figure 1.,,,,
"As previously discussed, the person immediately notices a large pattern first goal world cup.",,,,
"Hovering her mouse over cup tells her that this pattern appears 36,081 times.",,,,
"In other words, close to 40% of tweets about the World Cup posted in this 15 minutes time window include the pattern first goal world cup.",,,,
"As she hovers the mouse over a few other branches, she notices patterns like brazil marcelo score first goal world cup and first own goal world cup history.",,,,
"After exploring more branches and reading some example tweets, she concludes that most Tweets were either describing what happened on the soccer field or expressing excitement over the goal and surp,rise,at Marcel,""o's big blunder.,""",,,,
Second Goal The person moves on to the second goal of the game (Figure 7).,,,,
She immediately notices that the biggest branch is centered around neymar.,,,,
"Hovering over the branches she notices people mentioning that Brazilian player Neymar had scored the second goal of the game, which brings the score to 1-1.",,,,
She also notices branches like yellow Neymar and Neymar card.,,,,
She clicks on them to bring up example tweets explaining that Neymar had drawn a yellow card minutes before he scored the goal.,,,,
The person clicks on Neymar to bring up a detailed view.,,,,
"This view directs her to longer patterns about Neymar which she explores for a while, learning that at age 22 Neymar was considered a ?쐀oy wonder??and this was the 32nd goal he scored for Brazil, m,aking,him the,""third highest Brazilian goalscorer.,""",,,,
"Zooming back to the full view, she also notices a branch centered around goal.",,,,
"Hover her mouse over the branches, she finds patterns such as own goal, score own goal, and marcelo goal which indicates that people were still discussing the first goal of the game being an own goa,""l.,"",,",,,,
She also saw a big branch under game which reads first game world cup tonight wait par coma majooooorr.,,,,
"Intrigued, she clicks on the branch to bring up an example tweet and discovers that people were retweeting an earlier tweet by Niall Horan which says ?쏤irst game of the World Cup tonight!",,,,
Can?셳 wait!,,,,
PRA CIMA MAJOOOOORR!,,,,
CMON BRAZIIIILLLLL!??,,,,
Niall Horan is a member of the popular boy band One Direction and one of the most followed celebrities on Twitter.,,,,
Therefore it is not surprising that his tweet was retweeted so many times.,,,,
Third Goal The person moves on to the third goal of the game (Figure 8a).,,,,
She sees that a large branch is centered around the word penalty and another branch is centered around neymar.,,,,
Hovering the mouse over a few branches she learns that Neymar scored a penalty kick for Brazil making the score 2-1.,,,,
"She is interested in learning more about people's reaction to the penalty goal, so she zooms in on penalty.",,,,
Figure 8b shows a detailed view with penalty at the root.,,,,
"The person notices some new words connected to penalty, such as bad, soft, never to its left and unbelievable and bad to its right.",,,,
She hovers the mouse over these words to see the branches and also brings up a few example tweets.,,,,
"She learns that the penalty decision was controversial, as Twitter users call it ?쐗asn?셳 a penalty??,?쐍ever a penalty?? ?쐓oft penalty?? ?쐀ad penalty?? \x0c?쐗orst penalty decision?? and even ?쐕,nbel,ievable??,"",""",,,,
"Zooming out and looking at the full view, the person notices that Niall Horan's tweet was still being retweeted by many followers.",,,,
She also notices a tweet by @garylineker with many retweets.,,,,
Clicking on the branch she brings up the original tweet.,,,,
"It appears to be a rather unflattering joke towards FIFA president Sepp Blatter which was echoed by over 3,000 Twitter users.",,,,
(@GaryLineker: ?쏧 like this vanishing spray FIFA are using for the World Cup.,,,,
"Would it work on Sepp Blatter??? By going through the three goal visualizations, the person was able to form a coherent narrative of not only what happened on the field, but also how people reacted,to ea,ch goal.,"",""",,,,
"She discovered that people were shocked by the first own goal, applauded the second goal by Neymar, and were unhappy with the penalty goal which gave Brazil a lead in the game.",,,,
They were excited by the dramatic opening game and expectant of the rest of the World Cup.,,,,
This is a typical use case of the SentenTree visualization for exploring a large dataset (or datasets).,,,,
"In the initial stage, SentenTree supports impression-forming just as a word cloud.",,,,
"In addition, it provides context for each word by placing the words within sequential patterns and allows easy highlighting of patterns through hovering.",,,,
When interested in a sequential pattern the viewer can click on it to drill down to see more details.,,,,
The viewer also can click on sequential patterns to bring up example sentences.,,,,
"Because Tweet-reading typically happens after the viewer has formed initial expressions of the dataset, the person only needs to bring up sentences that look relevant instead of drowning in a sea of,text,"".,"",",,,,
"4.2 Natural content clustering In the previous section, we illustrated the use of the SentenTree visualization to explore social media reactions to a high-profile event.",,,,
"Based on our experiences applying SentenTree to different datasets, we have observed that for datasets with somewhat diverse content, SentenTree often results in natural clustering of texts.",,,,
"In this section, we give three examples of natural clustering and discuss how SentenTree can be used to explore these datasets.",,,,
"4.2.1 Communicating multiple word meanings We obtained a dataset of tweets posted on Aug 1, 2014 with the keyword ?쐙osemite??",,,,
"As yosemite is present in every tweet in the dataset, it is not allowed in the first step of sequential pattern generation.",,,,
The resulting visualization is shown in Figure 9.,,,,
"Yosemite is a word with ambiguous usage, and this is reflected in the visualization.",,,,
We observe that the biggest branch is about OS X Yosemite (a version of the Mac operation system).,,,,
Another smaller branch is also about the Mac OS with Apple as the most prominent word in the branch.,,,,
Another usage of the word ?쐙osemite??is the name of a national park in California.,,,,
We find one branch with yosemite national park california and another branch about a wildfire in the park.,,,,
SentenTree is able to separate tweets on the Mac OS and the national park without any semantic analysis.,,,,
4.2.2 Communicating multiple concepts A SentenTree visualization of tweets about the startup Eat24 retrieved shortly after Yelp's announcement to acquire the company resulted in three clusters.,,,,
(Please refer to the supplement material for the image.),,,,
The first is a branch focused around the sequential pattern yelp eat24 about the news of the acquisition worded in slightly different ways.,,,,
The second is a branch with @eat24 at the center that appears to be Eat24's official Twitter account which interacts with its customers frequently.,,,,
"From the visualization we learn that customers communicate with @eat24 to talk about the mobile app, coupons, their order, etc.",,,,
A final small branch has eat24 without yelp.,,,,
"Expanding the branch, we discover that tweets in this branch are focused on Eat24's Super Bowl commercial with rapper Snoop Dogg.",,,,
"4.2.3 Communicating multiple facets So far, all examples we have shown are tweets.",,,,
We include a final dataset of consumer reviews to illustrate another application of the technique.,,,,
We include this case to demonstrate SentenTree's power to highlight different facets in a dataset.,,,,
The dataset includes reviews crawled from Amazon.com about a Samsung TV model.,,,,
"As the unit of analysis is a single sentence, we segment the reviews into sentences before feeding them to SentenTree.",,,,
We also specify a rule that samsung and tv should not be used in the first round when generating sequential patterns as we do not want these words to dominate the view.,,,,
Figure 10 is the SentenTree visualization of the dataset.,,,,
The visualization consists of several branches each having a bigger word in the center and a set of smaller words on both sides.,,,,
These branches are reminiscent of a double-sided Word Tree (e.g. the Double Tree).,,,,
This indicates that the data set does not have longer frequent sequential patterns.,,,,
"The likely reasons are 1) the dataset is considerably smaller than the previous tweet datasets and there simply are not enough sentences to form similar long sentences, and 2) in consumer reviews pe,ople,tend to w,""rite longer paragraphs with more variations in their expressions than what people tend to write on Twitter.,""",,,,
"Although there are no long patterns, the branches give indications to different facets people frequently mention.",,,,
"There are picture, sound, amazon, lcd which are all product/services facets of the TV.",,,,
"By browsing the words used together with each facet word, the viewer is able to learn what people like and/or dislike about each facet.",,,,
Major branches with great and with good at the center are evident.,,,,
"By looking at these branches the viewer is able to figure out that reviewers report positive feelings about the picture, the price, Amazon, and the TV in general.",,,,
"Consumer reviews research suggests representing facets as nouns and using adjectives or phrases close to the nouns to describe each facet [20, 21, 46].",,,,
"Although SentenTree does not perform parts-ofspeech analysis, facets (such as ?쐏icture?? ?쐓ound?? etc.)",,,,
naturally emerge because the words are used frequently by reviewers.,,,,
Additionally the words that frequently co-occur with facet words are shown on either side of the facet words.,,,,
"We argue that SentenTree serves well as a generic tool for someone casually exploring a review dataset, especially considering it does not perform complex natural language processing.",,,,
5 I NITIAL U SER F EEDBACK We showed SentenTree to three people to gain initial feedback about the system.,,,,
All three are research scientists or data scientists at technology companies who regularly work with social media text.,,,,
We gave each a short demo of SentenTree and asked them to use the system to analyze a few Twitter datasets.,,,,
We observed how they interacted with the visualization and asked for feedback at the end of the session.,,,,
"All three people immediately understood the correspondence between font size/color and frequency, and all of them spent significant time hovering the cursor over different words in the view to read,examp,le tweets,"".,""",,,,
"The participants had to be reminded of the less discoverable functionalities (such as clicking to drill into a pattern, searching, and zooming).",,,,
"It also initially surprised them when they saw the same word multiple times in the visualization, but once they were given an explanation and used hover to check that the word appeared in different,patte,""rns, they"",""became comfortable with the concept.,""",,,,
All three people found SentenTree enjoyable to use and commented that it added fun to reading text.,,,,
They also found SentenTree effective for helping to explore text datasets.,,,,
"The aspects of the technique receiving most positive comments include: ??The most frequent words and patterns ?쐏op out??in the visualization because they are larger and darker, and the frequency co,unt c,an be rea,""d in a tooltip.,""",,,,
??The context to a word or pattern is immediately available by cursor hover.,,,,
??Similar content is grouped into a graph or branch that makes it easy to form an impression of the major topics.,,,,
??The visualization can serve as a filtering tool and greatly saves time in finding interesting content to read.,,,,
??Less frequent content is not eliminated; instead it is put into small but discoverable branches.,,,,
??One can keep drilling down into interesting branches and search for words on the screen.,,,,

??Improvements to the UI such as packing the graphs tightly to reduce white space and sorting vertically parallel branches by frequency or alphabetic order.,,,,
??Perform sentiment analysis and color-code words by sentiment.,,,,
??Render the example text in its original form.,,,,
Some of the tweets they saw contained images that provide important context and it may be helpful to render them inline.,,,,
"??Reduce the noise in the visualization, e.g., provide an option to filter out certain words such as hashtags.",,,,
??Provide the ability to 詮걄ter on meta-information.,,,,
"For example, one of the people works with geographic information regularly and asked for the ability to 詮걄ter text based on author location.",,,,
"6 D ISCUSSION We designed the SentenTree technique to provide a number of the key benefits evident in both word clouds and the Word Tree, while also overcoming some of the limitations of each.",,,,
"SentenTree highlights the important (most frequent) words as do word clouds, but it fills in the connections between words to communicate sentence structure and underlying concepts, themes, and idea,s mor,e fully.,"",""",,,,
"A Word Tree shows the most frequent prior and following words and sentence fragments clearly, but a person must select a word to serve as the focus for the visualization.",,,,
"SentenTree, conversely, constructs a network of sentence fragments and automatically extracts and shows different words that effectively serve as foci within the visualization.",,,,
"Additionally, the interactive capabilities of SentenTree allow a person to see specific connected sets of words just as they would appear, in order, in social media posts.",,,,
A person can use interaction to effectively ?쐂rill-down??and display the individual postings from which words are taken.,,,,
We envision SentenTree as a helpful component in many other text and document visualization systems.,,,,
SentenTree is designed in a modular way so it may be customized or integrated into a multi-view system.,,,,
Multiple people to whom we have demoed the system have commented that they would like to incorporate SentenTree as a view in their systems.,,,,
"Like many research techniques, SentenTree has limitations.",,,,
It is arguably less intuitive to interpret than word clouds and the Word Tree in its raw static form.,,,,
Viewers may infer patterns or sequences of words that do not occur within the collection unless they use the interactive capabilities of the system.,,,,
"That reliance on interaction, which in general provides power to a visualization, is also a potential shortcoming.",,,,
"The technique also does not pack visual elements (i.e., words) in a dense and efficient manner into a rectangular region.4 Often, visualizations produced with the system exhibit quite a bit of white,space,"".,"",",,,,
"For tools where screen real estate is at a premium, this can be a problem.",,,,
nother limitation of the current technique is that it does not explicitly communicate any information about the temporal ordering of the social media messages it is portraying.,,,,
"As we demonstrated with the World Cup dataset, each SentenTree visualization is a snapshot of text between a period of time, and the viewer has to create multiple visualizations to see how content c,hange,s through,""time.,""",,,,
"Finally, as discussed in Section 3.5, the algorithm for generating a SentenTree does not run in interactive real time.",,,,
"For collections around 100,000 social media messages, the system takes about 20 seconds to produce a final visualization that is ready for viewing and interaction.",,,,
"Ideally, SentenTree could be integrated into a surrounding system in a way that would lessen the impact of waiting.",,,,
"However, the time to run the algorithm means the visualization is not dynamic and cannot be changed on the 詮굖.",,,,
"For example, SentenTree does not support merging or removing of words in the view because removing a frequent word would cause all patterns containing that world to be re-created.",,,,
"In that case, the final graphs might look completely different.",,,,
"7 C ONCLUSION We have presented SentenTree, a novel visualization technique for social media text.",,,,
"By visualizing frequent sequential patterns, we have sought to find a sweet spot between displaying discrete words and showing full sentences.",,,,
We described an algorithm for incrementally generating these frequent sequential patterns and visualizing them.,,,,
"Through a number of examples, we also illustrated how SentenTree can help people gain a rapid understanding of key concepts and opinions in a large text collection.",,,,
"For future work, we plan to adopt some of the useful feedback gathered from our initial user trials such as encoding sentiment, showing temporality, or providing dynamic controls.",,,,
"We also plan to evaluate the technique with more people, in particular, have people try the technique on data of interest to them.",,,,
Eventually we plan to host SentenTree online and provide an interface for anyone to upload their own datasets.,,,,
We want to learn how people explore their own data with SentenTree and test the application with very large datasets.,,,,
"User-directed Sentiment Analysis: Visualizing the Affective Content of Documents Abstract Recent advances in text analysis have led to finer-grained semantic analysis, including automatic sentiment,analy,sis??the,""task of measuring documents, or chunks of text, based on emotive categories, such as positive or negative.,""",,,,
"However, considerably less progress has been made on efficient ways of exploring these measurements.",,,,
This paper discusses approaches for visualizing the affective content of documents and describes an interactive capability for exploring emotion in a large document collection.,,,,
"1 Introduction Recent advances in text analysis have led to finer-grained semantic classification, which enables the automatic exploration of subtle areas of meaning.",,,,
"One area that has received a lot of attention is automatic sentiment analysis?봳he task of classifying documents, or chunks of text, into emotive categories, such as positive or negative.",,,,
Sentiment analysis is generally used for tracking people's attitudes about particular individuals or items.,,,,
"For example, corporations use sentiment analysis to determine employee attitude and customer satisfaction with their products.",,,,
"Given the plethora of data in digital form, the ability to accurately and efficiently measure the emotional content of documents is paramount.",,,,
"The focus of much of the automatic sentiment analysis research is on identifying the affect bearing words (words with emotional content) and on measurement approaches for sentiment (Turney & Littman,"", 200"",3; Pang &,""Lee, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005).,""",,,,
"While identifying related content is an essential component for automatic sentiment analysis, it only provides half the story.",,,,
A useful area of research that has received much less attention is how these measurements might be presented to the users for exploration and added value.,,,,
This paper discusses approaches for visualizing affect and describes an interactive capability for exploring emotion in a large document collection.,,,,
"In Section 2 we review current approaches to identifying the affective content of documents, as well as possible ways of visualizing it.",,,,
In Section 3 we describe our approach: The combination of a lexical scoring method to determine the affective content of documents and a visual analytics tool for visualizing it.,,,,
"We provide a detailed case study in Section 4, followed by a discussion of possible evaluations.",,,,
"2 Background At the AAAI Symposium on Attitude and Affect held at Stanford in 2004 (Qu et al., 2005), it was clear that the lexical approach to capturing affect was adequate for broad brush results,,but,there wer,""e no production quality visualizations for presenting those results analytically.,""",,,,
"Thus, we began exploring methods and tools for the visualization of lexically-based approaches for measuring affect which could facilitate the exploration of affect within a text collection.",,,,
"2.1 Affect Extraction Following the general methodology of informational retrieval, there are two pre-dominant methods for identifying sentiment in text: Text classification models and lexical appro,aches,"".,"",",,,,
"Classification models require that a set of documents are hand labeled for affect, and a system is \x0ctrained on the feature vectors associated with labels.",,,,
New text is automatically classified by comparing the feature vectors with the training set.,,,,
"(Pang & Lee, 2004; Aue & Gamon, 2005).",,,,
This methodology generally requires a large amount of training data and is domain dependent.,,,,
"In the lexical approach, documents (Turney & Littman, 2003), phrases (see Wilson et al., 2005), or sentences (Weibe & Riloff, 2005) are categorized as positive or negative, for example, based on the,numb,er of wor,""ds in them that match a lexicon of sentiment bearing terms.,""",,,,
Major drawbacks of this approach include the contextual variability of sentiment (what is positive in one domain may not be in another) and incomplete coverage of the lexicon.,,,,
"This latter drawback is often circumvented by employing bootstrapping (Turney & Littman, 2003; Weibe & Riloff, 2005) which allows one to create a larger lexicon from a small number of seed words, an,d pot,entially,""one specific to a particular domain.,""",,,,
"2.2 Affect Visualization The uses of automatic sentiment classification are clear (public opinion, customer reviews, product analysis, etc.).",,,,
"However, there has not been a great deal of research into ways of visualizing affective content in ways that might aid data exploration and the analytic process.",,,,
"There are a number of visualizations designed to reveal the emotional content of text, in particular, text that is thought to be highly emotively charged such as conversational transcripts and chat,room,transcrip,""ts (see DiMicco et al., 2002; Tat & Carpendale, 2002; Lieberman et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004, for example).,""",,,,
"Aside from using color and emoticons to explore individual documents (Liu et al., 2003) or email inboxes (Mandic & Kerne, 2004), there are very few visualizations suitable for exploring the affect o,f lar,ge collec,""tions of text.,""",,,,
"One exception is the work of Liu et al. (2005) in which they provide a visualization tool to compare reviews of products,using a bar graph metaphor.",,,,
"Their system automatically extracts product features (with associated affect) through parsing and pos tagging, having to handle exceptional cases individually.",,,,
Their Opinion Observer is a powerful tool designed for a single purpose: comparing customer reviews.,,,,
"In this paper, we introduce a visual analytic tool designed to explore the emotional content of large collections of open domain documents.",,,,
"The tools described here work with document collections of all sizes, structures (html, xml, .doc, email, etc), sources (private collections, web, etc.",,,,
"), and types of document collections.",,,,
"The visualization tool is a mature tool that supports the analytical process by enabling users to explore the thematic content of the collection, use natural language to query the collection, make g,roups,"", view do"",""cuments by time, etc.,""",,,,
"The ability to explore the emotional content of an entire collection of documents not only enables users to compare the range of affect in documents within the collection, but also allows them to re,late,affect to,""other dimensions in the collection, such as major topics and themes, time, and source.,""",,,,
3 The Approach Our methodology combines a traditional lexical approach to scoring documents for affect with a mature visualization tool.,,,,
We first automatically identify affect by comparing each document against a lexicon of affect-bearing words and obtain an affect score for each document.,,,,
We provide a number of visual metaphors to represent the affect in the collection and a number of tools that can be used to interactively explore the affective content of the data.,,,,
3.1 Lexicon and Measurement We use a lexicon of affect-bearing words to identify the distribution of affect in the documents.,,,,
"Our lexicon authoring system allows affectbearing terms, and their associated strengths, to be bulk loaded, declared manually, or algorithmically suggested.",,,,
"In this paper, we use a lexicon derived from the General Inquirer (GI) and supplemented with lexical items derived from a semi-supervised bootstrapping task.",,,,
"The GI tool is a computer-assisted approach for content analyses of textual data (Stone, 1977).",,,,
"It includes an extensive lexicon of over 11,000 handcoded word stems and 182 categories.",,,,
"We used this lexicon, specifically the positive and negative axes, to create a larger lexicon by bootstrapping.",,,,
"Lexical bootstrapping is a method used to help expand dictionaries of semantic categories (Riloff & Jones, 1999) in the context of a document set of interest.",,,,
The approach we have adopted begins with a lexicon of affect bearing words (POS and NEG) and a corpus.,,,,
Each document in the corpus receives an affect score by counting the number of words from the seed lexicon that occur in the document; a separate score is given for each affect axis.,,,,
"Words in the corpus are scored for affect potential by comparing their distribution (using an L1 Distri- \x0cbution metric) of occurrence over the set if documents to the distribution of affect bear,ing w,""ords.,"",",,,,
Words that compare favorably with affect are hypothesized as affect bearing words.,,,,
Results are then manually culled to determine if in fact they should be included in the lexicon.,,,,
"Here we report on results using a lexicon built from 8 affect categories, comprising 4 concept pairs: ????????Positive (n=2236)-Negative (n=2708) Virtue (n=638)-Vice (n=649) Pleasure (n=151)-Pain (n,=220),Power Co,""operative (n=103)-Power Conflict (n=194) Each document in the collection is compared against all 8 affect categories and receives a score for each.,""",,,,
"Scores are based on the summation of each affect axis in the document, normalized by the number of words in the documents.",,,,
"This provides an overall proportion of positive words, for example, per document.",,,,
"Scores can also be calculated as the summation of each axis, normalized by the total number of affect words for all axes.",,,,
This allows one to quickly estimate the balance of affect in the documents.,,,,
"For example, using this measurement, one could see that a particular document contains as many positive as negative terms, or if it is heavily skewed towards one or the other.",,,,
"While the results reported here are based on a predefined lexicon, our system does include a Lexicon Editor in which a user can manually enter their own lexicon or add strengths to lexical items.",,,,
Included in the editor is a Lexicon Bootstrapping Utility which the user can use to help create a specialized lexicon of their own.,,,,
This utility runs as described above.,,,,
"Note that while we enable the capability of strength, we have not experimented with that variable here.",,,,
All words for all axes have a default strength of .5.,,,,
"3.2 Visualization To visualize the affective content of a collection of documents, we combined a variety of visual metaphors with a tool designed for visual analytics of documents, IN-SPIRE.",,,,
"3.2.1 The IN-SPIRE System IN-SPIRE (Hetzler and Turner, 2004) is a visual analytics tool designed to facilitate rapid understanding of large textual corpora.",,,,
IN-SPIRE generates a compiled document set from mathematical signatures for each document in a set.,,,,
Document signatures are clustered according to common themes to enable information exploration and visualizations.,,,,
Information is presented to the user using several visual metaphors to expose different facets of the textual data.,,,,
"The central visual metaphor is a Galaxy view of the corpus that allows users to intuitively interact with thousands of documents, examining them by theme (see Figure 4, below).",,,,
"IN-SPIRE leverages the use of context vectors such as LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) for document clustering and projection.",,,,
"Additional analytic tools allow exploration of temporal trends, thematic distribution by source or other metadata, and query relationships and overlaps.",,,,
IN-SPIRE was recently enhanced to support visual analysis of sentiment.,,,,
"3.2.2 Visual Metaphors In selecting metaphors to represent the affect scores of documents, we started by identifying the kinds of questions that users would want to explore.",,,,
"Consider, as a guiding example, a set of customer reviews for several commercial products (Hu & Liu, 2004).",,,,
"A user reviewing this data might be interested in a number of questions, such as: ??What is the range of affect overall?",,,,
??Which products are viewed most positively?,,,,
Most negatively?,,,,
??What is the range of affect for a particular product?,,,,
??How does the affect in the reviews deviate from the norm?,,,,
Which are more negative or positive than would be expected from the averages?,,,,
??How does the feedback of one product compare to that of another?,,,,
??Can we isolate the affect as it pertains to different features of the products?,,,,
"In selecting a base metaphor for affect, we wanted to be able to address these kinds of questions.",,,,
We wanted a metaphor that would support viewing affect axes individually as well as in pairs.,,,,
"In addition to representing the most common axes, negative and positive, we wanted to provide more flexibility by incorporating the ability to portray multiple pairs because we suspect that addition,al ax,es will h,""elp the user explore nuances of emotion in the data.,""",,,,
"For our current metaphor, we drew inspiration from the Rose plot used by Florence Nightingale (Wainer, 1997).",,,,
"This metaphor is appealing in that it is easily interpreted, that larger scores draw more \x0cattention, and that measures are shown in consistent relative location, making it easier to compare meas,ures,across do,""cument groups.,""",,,,
We use a modified version of this metaphor in which each axis is represented individually but is also paired with its opposite to aid in direct comparisons.,,,,
"To this end, we vary the spacing between the rose petals to reinforce the pairing.",,,,
"We also use color; each pair has a common hue, with the more positive of the pair shown in a lighter shade and the more negative one in a darker shade (see Figure 1).",,,,
"To address how much the range of affect varies across a set of documents, we adapted the concept of a box plot to the rose petal.",,,,
"For each axis, we show the median and quartile values as shown in the figure below.",,,,
The dark line indicates the median value and the color band portrays the quartiles.,,,,
"In the plot in Figure 1, for example, the scores vary quite a bit.",,,,
"To convey the Residual concept, we needed a representation of deviation from expected value.",,,,
We also wanted this portrayal to be similar to the base metaphor.,,,,
"We use a unit circle to portray the expected value and show deviation by drawing the appropriate rose petals either outside (larger than expected) or inside (smaller than expected) the unit circle,,with,the color,""amount showing the amount of deviation from expected.,""",,,,
"In the figures below, the dotted circle represents expected value.",,,,
The glyph on the left shows a cluster with scores slightly higher than expected for Positive and for Cooperation affect.,,,,
The glyph on the right shows a cluster with scores slightly higher than expected for the Negative and Vice affect axes (Figure 2).,,,,
Figure 2.,,,,
Rose plot adapted to show deviation from expected values.,,,,
3.2.3 Figure 1.,,,,
Rose plot adapted to show median and quartile variation.,,,,
Another variation we made on the base metaphor was to address a more subtle set of questions.,,,,
It may happen that the affect scores within a dataset are largely driven by document membership in particular groups.,,,,
"For example, in our customer data, it may be that all documents about Product A are relatively positive while those about Product B are relatively negative.",,,,
A user wanting to understand customer complaints may have a subtle need.,,,,
"It is not sufficient to just look at the most negative documents in the dataset, because none of the Product A documents may pass this threshold.",,,,
"What may also help is to look at all documents that are more negative than one would expect, given the product they discuss.",,,,
"To carry out this calculation, we use a statistical technique to calculate the Main (or expected) affect value for each group and the Residual (or deviation) affect value for each document with resp,ect t,o its gro,""up (Scheffe, 1999).,""",,,,
"Visual Interaction IN-SPIRE includes a variety of analytic tools that allow exploration of temporal trends, thematic distribution by source or other metadata, and query relationships and overlaps.",,,,
We have incorporated several interaction capabilities for further exploration of the affect.,,,,
"Our analysis system allows users to group documents in numerous ways, such as by query results, by metadata (such as the product), by time frame, and by similarity in themes.",,,,
A user can select one or more of these groups and see a summary of affect and its variation in those groups.,,,,
"In addition, the group members are clustered by their affect scores and glyphs of the residual, or variation from expected value, are shown for each of these sub-group clusters.",,,,
Below each rose we display a small histogram showing the number of documents represented by that glyph (see Figure 3).,,,,
These allow comparison of affect to cluster or group size.,,,,
"For example, we find that extreme affect scores are typically found in the smaller clusters, while larger ones often show more mid-range scores.",,,,
"As the user selects document groups or clusters, we show the proportion of documents selected.",,,,
"We begin by clustering the reviews, based on overall thematic content.",,,,
The labels are automatically generated and indicate some of the stronger theme combinations in this dataset.,,,,
These clusters are driven largely by product vocabulary.,,,,
"The two cameras cluster in the lower portion; the Zen shows up in the upper right clusters, with the phone in the middle and the Apex DVD player in the upper left and upper middle.",,,,
"In this image, the pink dots are the Apex DVD reviews.",,,,
Figure 3.,,,,
"Clusters by affect score, with one rose plot per cluster.",,,,
The interaction may also be driven from the affect size.,,,,
"If a given clustering of affect characteristics is selected, the user can see the themes they represent, how they correlate to metadata, or the time distribution.",,,,
We illustrate how the affect visualization and interaction fit into a larger analysis with a brief case study.,,,,
"4 Case study The IN-SPIRE visualization tool is a non-data specific tool, designed to explore large amounts of textual data for a variety of genres and document types (doc, xml, etc).",,,,
"Many users of the system have their own data sets they wish to explore (company internal documents), or data can be harvested directly from the web, either in a single web harvest, or dynamically.",,,,
"The case study and dataset presented here is intended as an example only, it does not represent the full range of exploration capabilities of the affective content of datasets.",,,,
"We explore a set of customer reviews, comprising a collection of Amazon reviews for five products (Hu & Liu, 2004).",,,,
"While a customer may not want to explore reviews for 5 different product types at once, the dataset is realistic in that a web harvest of one review site will contain reviews of multiple products.",,,,
This allows us to demonstrate how the tool enables users to focus on the data and comparisons that they are interested in exploring.,,,,
"The 5 products in this dataset are: ??Canon G3; digital camera ??Nikon coolpix 4300; digital camera ??Nokia 6610; cell phone ??Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB; mp3 player ??Apex AD2600 Pro,gress,ive-scan,""DVD player Figure 4.,""",,,,
"Thematic clustering of product review The affect measurements on these documents generate five clusters in our system, each of which is summarized with a rose plot showing affect variation.",,,,
This gives us information on the range and distribution of affect overall in this data.,,,,
"We can select one of these plots, either to review the documents or to interact further.",,,,
"Selection is indicated with a green border, as shown in the upper middle plot of Figure 5.",,,,
Figure 5.,,,,
"Clusters by affect, with one cluster glyph selected.",,,,
The selected documents are relatively positive; they have higher scores in the Positive and Virtue axes and lower scores in the Negative axis.,,,,
We may want to see how the documents in this \x0caffect cluster distribute over the five products.,,,,
"This question is answered by the correlation tool, shown in Figure 6; the positive affect cluster contains more reviews on the Zen MP3 player than any of the other products.",,,,
Figure 8.,,,,
Summary of Apex products with subclusters showing deviations.,,,,
Figure 6.,,,,
Products represented in one of the positive affect clusters.,,,,
Alternatively we could get a summary of affect per product.,,,,
Figure 7 shows the affect for the Apex DVD player and the Nokia cell phone.,,,,
"While both are positive, the Apex has stronger negative ratings than the Nokia.",,,,
Figure 9.,,,,
Thematic distribution of reviews for one product (Apex).,,,,
Figure 7.,,,,
Comparison of Affect Scores of Nokia to Apex More detail is apparent by looking at the clusters within one or more groups and examining the deviations.,,,,
Figure 8 shows the sub-clusters within the Apex group.,,,,
"We include the summary for the group as a whole (directly beneath the Apex label), and then show the four sub-clusters by illustrating how they deviate from expected value.",,,,
We see that two of these tend to be more positive than expected and two are more negative than expected.,,,,
Looking at the thematic distribution among the Apex documents shows topics that dominate its reviews (Figure 9).,,,,
We can examine the affect across these various clusters.,,,,
Figure 10 shows the comparison of the ?쐓ervice??cluster to the ?쐂vd player picture??cluster.,,,,
"This graphic demonstrates that documents with ?쐓ervice??as a main theme tend to be much more negative, while documents with ?쐏icture??as a main theme are much more positive.",,,,
Figure 10.,,,,
Affect summary and variation for ?쐓ervice??cluster and ?쐏icture??cluster.,,,,
The visualization tool includes a document viewer so that any selection of documents can be reviewed.,,,,
"For example, a user may be interested in why the ?쐓ervice??documents tend to be negative, in which case they can review the original reviews.",,,,
"The doc viewer, shown in Figure 11, can be used at any stage in the process with any number of documents selected.",,,,
Individual documents can be viewed by clicking on a document title in the upper portion of the doc viewer.,,,,
Figure 11: The Doc Viewer.,,,,
"In this case study, we have illustrated the usefulness of visualizing the emotional content of a document collection.",,,,
"Using the tools presented here, we can summarize the dataset by saying that in general, the customer reviews are positive (Figure 5), but reviews for some products are more positive than others (Fig,ures,6 and 7).,"",""",,,,
"In addition to the general content of the reviews, we can narrow our focus to the features contained in the reviews.",,,,
"We saw that while reviews for Apex are generally positive (Figure 8), reviews about Apex ?쐓ervice??tend to be much more negative than reviews about Apex ?쐏icture??(Figure 10).",,,,
5 Evaluation IN-SPIRE is a document visualization tool that is designed to explore the thematic content of a large collection of documents.,,,,
"In this paper, we have described the added functionality of exploring affect as one of the possible dimensions.",,,,
"As an exploratory system, it is difficult to define appropriate evaluation metric.",,,,
"Because the goal of our system is not to discretely bin the documents into affect categories, traditional metrics such as precision are not applicable.",,,,
"However, to get a sense of the coverage of our lexicon, we did compare our measurements to the hand annotations provided for the customer review dataset.",,,,
The dataset had hand scores (-3-3) for each feature contained in each review.,,,,
We summed these scores to discretely bin them into positive (>0) or negative (<0).,,,,
We did this both at the feature level and the review level (by looking at the cumulative score for all the features in the review).,,,,
We compared these categorizations to the scores output by our measurement tool.,,,,
"If a document had a higher proportion of positive words than negative, we classified it as positive, and negative if it had a higher proportion of negative words.",,,,
"Using a chi-square, we found that the categorizations from our system were related with the hand annotations for both the whole reviews (chi-square=33.02, df=4, p<0.0001) and the individual features,(chi,square=15,""0.6, df=4, p<0.0001), with actual agreement around 71% for both datasets.,""",,,,
"While this number is not in itself impressive, recall that our lexicon was built independently of the data for which is was applied.",,,,
"W also expect some agreement to be lost by conflating all scores into discrete bins, we expect that if we compared the numeric values of the hand annotations and our scores, we would have stronger c,orrel,""ations.,"",",,,,
These scores only provide an indication that the lexicon we used correlates with the hand annotations for the same data.,,,,
"As an exploratory system, however, a better evaluation metric would be a user study in which we get feedback on the usefulness of this capability in accomplishing a variety of analytical tasks.",,,,
"IN-SPIRE is currently deployed in a number of settings, both commercial and government.",,,,
The added capabilities for interactively exploring affect have recently been deployed.,,,,
We plan to conduct a variety of user evaluations in-situ that focus on its utility in a number of different tasks.,,,,
Results of these studies will help steer the further development of this methodology.,,,,
6 Conclusion We have developed a measurement and visualization approach to affect that we expect to be useful in the context of the IN-SPIRE text analysis toolkit.,,,,
"Our innovations include the flexibility of the lexicons used, the measurement options, the bootstrapping method and utility for lexicon development, and the visualization of affect using rose plots,and i,nteractiv,""e exploration in the context of an established text analysis toolkit.,""",,,,
"While the case study presented here was conducted in English, all tools described are language independent and we have begun exploring and creating lexicons of affect bearing words in multiple langu,ages.,"","",",,,,
"References \x0cStoryteller: Visual Analytics of Perspectives on Rich Text Interpretations Abstract Complexity of event data in texts makes it difficult to assess its content, especially when conside,ring,larger co,""llections in which different sources report on the same or similar situations.,""",,,,
We present a system that makes it possible to visually analyze complex event and emotion data extracted from texts.,,,,
We show that we can abstract from different data models for events and emotions to a single data model that can show the complex relations in four dimensions.,,,,
"The visualization has been applied to analyze 1) dynamic developments in how people both conceive and express emotions in theater plays and 2) how stories are told from the perspective of their sour,ces b,ased on r,""ich event data extracted from news or biographies.,""",,,,
1 Introduction People frequently write about the changes in the world and about the emotions that these events arouse.,,,,
Events and emotions typically have complex structures and are difficult to detect and represent.,,,,
"According to our estimation, standard news articles contain about 200 event mentions on average (Vossen et al., 2016).",,,,
"These events stand in complex temporal and causal relations to each other, while the text can also present different perspectives on their impact.",,,,
"Especially when considering event data from many different sources that may report on the same events, the extracted data quickly becomes very complex.",,,,
Most systems that handle large collections of text use some kind of topic clustering.,,,,
Documents are grouped together on the basis of a similarity measure and clustering technique.,,,,
"In the case of streaming text, such as news and tweets, topic modeling and clustering is also done dynamically over time, indicating when a cluster appears and dies out.",,,,
Dynamic clustering can be seen as a rough approximation of the temporal bounding of a real world event.,,,,
"Although topic modeling works well as an indicator of trending real world events, it does not tell the story in detail as a sequence of events with participants and causal/temporal relations across,these,events.,"",""",,,,
"In this paper we present Storyteller, a visual analytics tool for complex multidimensional textual data.",,,,
Storyteller groups events with multiple participants into storylines.,,,,
"As such, it can give insight into complex relations by providing multiple perspectives on time-based textual data.",,,,
"We explain the capabilities of Storyteller by applying it to semantically linked news data from the NewsReader project,1 using different perspectives on the data to visualize complex relations betwe,en th,e events,""found by its Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline.,""",,,,
These visualizations give more insight into the performance of the system and how well complex event relations approximate the storylines people construct when reading news.,,,,
"We further show the usability of the Storyteller visualization for general purpose eventbased textual data by applying it to other use cases, namely the Embodied Emotions and BiographyNet projects p,rovid,ed by oth,""er humanities experts.,""",,,,
The paper is structured as follows.,,,,
"In Section 3, we present the semantic model for events used in NewsReader.",,,,
Section 4 explains the Storyteller visualization tool that loads the NewsReader data and provides different views and interactions.,,,,
We show the capacity of data generalization by the tool by applying it to other projects with biograph- \x0cical data and emotions in Dutch 17th century theater plays in Section 5.,,,,
Section 2 explains how our work differs from others.,,,,
Section 6 concludes with future plans.,,,,

"Processing a single news article results in the semantic interpretation of mentions of events, participants and their time anchoring in a sequence of text.",,,,
"In a second step, the mention interpretations are converted to an instance representation according to the Simple Event Model (Van Hage et al., 2011) or SEM.",,,,
SEM is an RDF representation that abstracts from the specific mentions within a single or across multiple news articles.,,,,
"It defines individual components of events such as the action, the participants with their roles and the time-anchoring.",,,,
"A central notion in NewsReader is the event-centric representation, where events are represented as instances and all information on these events is aggregated from all the mentions in different sou,rces.,"","",",,,,
"For this purpose, NewsReader introduced the Grounded Annotation Framework (GAF, (Fokkens et al., 2013)) as an extension to SEM through gaf:denotedBy relations between instance representations in SEM,and,their men,""tions represented as offsets to different places in the texts.,""",,,,
"Likewise, information that is the same across mentions in different news articles gets deduplicated and information that is different gets aggregated.",,,,
"For each piece of information, the system stores the source and the perspective of the source on the information.",,,,
"The result is a complex multidimensional data set in which events and their relations are defined according to multiple properties (Vossen et al., 2015).",,,,
"The Storyteller application exploits these dimensions to present events within a context that explains them, approximating a story.",,,,
The following dimensions from the NewsReader data are used for the visualization.,,,,
Event refers to the SEM-RDF ID: the instance identifier.,,,,
"The actors in the news article, which are described using role labels that come from different event ontologies, such as PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), and ESO,(Seg,ers et al,""., 2015).,""",,,,
A climax score indicating the relevance of the event (normalized between 0 and 100) for a story.,,,,
"The climax score is a normalized score based on the number of mentions of an event and the prominence of each mention, where early mentions count as more prominent.",,,,
A group label that uniquely identifies the event-group to which the event belongs.,,,,
"In NewsReader, groups are formed by connecting events by topic overlap of the articles in which they are mentioned and by sharing the same actors.",,,,
Each group also has a groupScore which indicates the relevance of the group or storyline for the whole collection.,,,,
"For NewsReader, this is the highest climax score within the group of events normalized across all the different groups extracted from a data set.",,,,
The group's groupName consists of the most dominant topic within the group in comparison with all other groups based on IDF*TF.,,,,
Event groups are the basis for event-centric story visualizations.,,,,
The labels represent all the different wordings used to mention the event.,,,,
The prefLabel is the most-frequent label for the event.,,,,
Time refers to the date to which the event is anchored.,,,,
Mentions is a list of mentions of the event in source texts.,,,,
"A mention consists of a snippet, the offsets of the label in that snippet (snippet char), the URI of the source text, and char, the character offsets for the raw text inside the source.",,,,
"Next we show an abbreviated example of a NewsReader event in the JSON format used in Storyteller: 500 kbit per second (Gregory and Zangwill, 1987), a large number of connections can make the visual,explo,ration ve,""ry difficult without filters to slice the data into humanly manageable portions.,""",,,,
This section presents the 3 views and describes how filtering can be applied.,,,,
The interactivity focuses mostly on analysis through filtering.,,,,
The user can apply filters by clicking through various components of the charts.,,,,
"These filters are then dynamically applied to the other parts of the application, reducing the amount of data on the screen.",,,,
"This allows a user to drilldown into the data, gaining knowledge of its composition in the process.",,,,
"4.1 Participation-centric view The participation-centric view (Figure 1), which is our own graph design that we have dubbed a Co-Participation graph, is an interactively filterable version of the XK,CD Mo,vie Narra,""tive Charts (Munroe, 2009).,""",,,,
It is placed at the top of the Storyteller page and visualizes the participants of all the events.,,,,
The major participants are placed on the Y-axis and the events they participate in are placed (as ovals) on a timeline.,,,,
Each participant's timeline has a different color.,,,,
"If different participants take part in the same event, the lines are bent towards and joint in this event, showing the coparticipation through this intersection.",,,,
Events receive descriptive labels.,,,,
"Hovering the mouse cursor over an event will show further details, such as the mentions of that specific event.",,,,
"4.1.1 4 Storyteller The Storyteller application consists of 3 main coordinated views (Wang Baldonado et al., 2000): a participant-centric view, an event-centric view and a data-centric view.",,,,
User interaction is a key component in the design.,,,,
"The rich text data are too complex to visualize without it, as they contain numerous interconnected events, participants and other properties.",,,,
"Given that the estimated processing capacity for accurate data of human sight is limited to around Axis ordering The X-axis is a timeline stretching between the first of the events shown and the las,""t.,"",,",,,,
The Y-axis is slightly more complicated.,,,,
The ordering of the participants is of great importance to the legibility of the resulting chart.,,,,
"If this is done improperly, the resulting chart will be cluttered because of many curved lines crossing each other unnecessarily.",,,,
We solved this legibility problem by ordering the elements in such a way that the participant lines travel straight for as long as possible.,,,,
"We do this by re-ordering the elements on the Y-axis in order of co-appearance on the timeline, from bottom to top.",,,,
We start by determining the first and bottom-most line.,,,,
"For this, we select the first event on the timeline and determine the participants of this event.",,,,
We then loop over all events that share these participants in order of appearance on the timeline.,,,,
"Every time a new co-participant is found \x0cin one of these events, it is added to the list.",,,,
"Once all events have been processed in this manner, the algorithm has clustered events that share participants making the resulting graph much easier to read.",,,,
4.1.2 Filtering An alphabetic list of all of the participants present in the dataset is displayed left of the Coparticipants graph.,,,,
The length of the colored bar indicates the number of events in which the participant occurs.,,,,
This number is shown when hovering the mouse over the bar.,,,,
Clicking on one of the items in the participant list applies a filter to the dataset.,,,,
The Co-participation graph only shows the lines with events that involve the selected participant.,,,,
This means that the line of the selected participant and those of participants that co-participate with the selected participant are displayed.,,,,
Selecting more than one participant reduces the graph to those events in which all selected participants coparticipate.,,,,
4.2 Event-centric view Figure 3 shows the event-centric view.,,,,
This second view in the Storyteller demo shows time ordered sequences of events grouped in different rows.,,,,
The grouping can be determined in different ways and according to different needs.,,,,
"In NewsReader, each row in the graph approximates the structure of a story, as defined in (Vossen et al., 2015): consisting of one or more climax events, preceded by events that build up towards the,clim,ax and fo,""llowing events that are the consequence of the climax defined by prominence (see section 3).,""",,,,
Preceding and following events are selected on the basis of co-participation and topicoverlap: so-called bridging relations.,,,,
The size (and color) of the event bubbles represents the climax score of the event.,,,,
"A climax event together with all bridged events approximate a story, where we expect events to increase in bubble size when getting closer to the climax event (the biggest bubble in a row) and then,gradu,ally decr,""ease after the climax event.,""",,,,
"The size of the events thus mimics the topical development of for example streaming news, while we still show details on the events within such a topic.",,,,
"The first row presents the story derived from the \x0cFigure 3: The event-centric view, with data of the Embodied Emotions project (See: Use Cases).",,,,
"Figure 4: The same event-centric view, with a filter applied to only show high-climax events from the year 1740 and onwards.",,,,
"Figure 5: The same event-centric view, with a filter applied to only show events with the fear emotion.",,,,
climax event with the highest score (normalized to 100).,,,,
The next rows show stories based on lower scoring climax events that are not connected to the main story.,,,,
We thus apply a greedy algorithm in which the most prominent events has the first chance to absorb other events.,,,,
Stories are labeled by the climax event's groupName (consisting of the topic that is dominant for the set of events making up the story and the highest climax score within the event).,,,,
"In addition to the label, each row has a colored bar that indicates the cumulative value of the climax scores of all the events within a story.",,,,
Note that the story with the highest climax event does not necessarily have the largest cumulative score.,,,,
"If an event is mentioned a lot but poorly connected to other events, the cu- \x0cmulative score may still be lower than that of other stories.",,,,
The bottom graph of the second view plots individual events for climax score on the Y-axis so that events from the same story may end up in different rows.,,,,
Group membership is indicated by symbols representing the events.,,,,
This view shows how events from a story are spread over climax scores and time.,,,,
4.4 The full system The seven tasks of the Visual Information Seeking Mantra Overview Gain an overview of the entire collection.,,,,
Zoom Zoom in on items of interest.,,,,
Filter Filter out uninteresting items.,,,,
Details-on-demand Select an item or group and get details when needed.,,,,
Relate View relationships among items.,,,,
4.2.1 Filtering The user can select a story by clicking on the index of stories to the left.,,,,
"Unlike the Participationcentric view, selecting more than one group or row adds data to the representation.",,,,
"This is intentionally different from the co-participation graph, where multiple selections intersect (groups can, in this context, by definition not intersect), because stories are separated on the,basis,of lack,""of overlap.,""",,,,
"In the bottom graph of the event-centric view, the user can make selections by dragging a region in the Y/X space with the mouse.",,,,
A region thus represents a segment in time and a segment of climax scores.,,,,
"This enables both selecting time intervals (by dragging a full height box between two particular time frames) and selection of the most (or least) influential events, which can be used to exclude ou,tlier,s in the,""data but also to select and inspect them.,""",,,,
All filters are applied globally: this means that participant selection in the top view influences the event-centric visualization and vice-versa.,,,,
"4.3 Data-centric view At the bottom of the Storyteller page, we see text snippets from the original texts that were used to derive the event data.",,,,
It lists all events visualized for a given set of filters.,,,,
Events are presented with the text fragments they are mentioned in and the event word is highlighted.,,,,
"The event labels are given separately as well, where synonyms are grouped together.",,,,
"Furthermore, the table shows the scores, the date and the group name or story label.",,,,
No selections can be made through this view.,,,,
"History Keep a history of actions to support undo, replay, and progressive refinement.",,,,
Extract Allow extraction of sub-collections and of the query parameters.,,,,
"(Shneiderman, 1996) We designed Storyteller following the (authoritative) Taxonomy for data visualizations (Shneiderman, 1996), phrased as the 7 tasks of the Visual Information Seeking Mantra: We in,itiat,e the vis,""ualization with the Overview task presenting the initial (unfiltered) v iew.,""",,,,
The Filter and Zoom tasks allow the selection of subsets of items in multiple ways through the different views.,,,,
The Details-on-demand task provides detailed mouse-over information boxes as well as a view into the raw data that is maintained while filtering.,,,,
"The co-participation graph supports the main Relate task, the filter state displays the History, and finally, the data-view allows users to Extract.",,,,
"Storyteller is built to be as generic, reusable and maintainable as possible.",,,,
We have used only Free and Open Source (FOSS) software web visualization tools and libraries and made Storyteller itself fully FOSS as well.,,,,
The code is available on github2 and a demo is also available.3 5 Expert Panel Use Cases The Storyteller demo has been used in two use cases other than NewsReader.,,,,
We briefly describe both use cases in this section.,,,,
"5.1 Embodied Emotions Embodied Emotions (Zwaan et al., 2015) is a digital history project that investigates the relation \x0cbetween body parts and emotions in Dutch stage plays over time (i.e.",,,,
"in what body parts do people experience emotions, and through which bodily acts do they express emotions).",,,,
"In our Storyteller visualization, emotions are events and body parts are participants.",,,,
The visualization can be applied at two levels.,,,,
"First, the X-axis of the Coparticipation graph can be used to represent the acts of a single play.",,,,
"Second, the X-axis can be used as a timeline where we plot which emotions and body parts are linked to each other in plays published in a specific year.",,,,
Intersections indicate when different body parts are associated with the same emotion.,,,,
"The current online demo shows the second type of visualization: emotion/body-part pairs occurrence per year.4 The climax score in this visualization reflects t he p rominence o f t he e motion ( the,occu,rrence of,""the emotion related to the number of sentences).,""",,,,
"5.2 BiographyNet The BiographyNet (Ockeloen et al., 2013) use case involves the visual exploration of biographies of prominent people in Dutch history.",,,,
The biographies have been processed by a pipeline similar to the one used for NewsReader.,,,,
"However, the data is radically different: biographies mainly contain events related to the subject of the biography and we do not find many instances of cross-document event co-reference.",,,,
"The BiographyNet demo5 therefore does not focus on event instances but on event types: we extract all events related to a person that can be linked to a specific year from the biographical text and,meta,""data.,"",",,,,
"The biography subjects are the participants in our visualization, the event types are the events.",,,,
"If two people are born in the same year, study during the same year or die in the same year, etc., their lines intersect.",,,,
The BiographyNet visualization thus allows historians to perform generation analyses: what other events have people born in a specific year have in common?,,,,
The climax score reflects the number of participants involved in an event.,,,,
The event-centric visualization thus shows which events are prominent in a given year.,,,,
6 Conclusion The fast and efficient web-based visualizations of the output of NLP pipelines allows us to visually analyze complex storylines spanning years.,,,,
"This means that we can now analyze news articles with much more context, be it by looking at coparticipants, co-occurrence or other such criteria.",,,,
This changes literature study from first having to read all the text to build an overview to first having a rough overview that allows you to decide which text to read later.,,,,
Storyteller's event-based input format makes it easy to port to new data sources.,,,,
We described two other projects with different graph-like data (biographies and emotions) that can be served with the same application thanks to this generic input format.,,,,
There are many directions in which this research could be advanced in the future.,,,,
"First, the interaction model should be completed.",,,,
"Although Storyteller allows the user to select and filter the data in almost all graphs, other interactivity could \x0cbe added.",,,,
"For example, currently, the data table (view 3) only shows the results of filters a nd selections applied in other views.",,,,
This table could be made interactive by adding search functionality.,,,,
This means that the data can be filtered based on user queries.,,,,
"Another possibility for improved interaction is to allow the user to re-order events, participants and groups according to different criteria (e.g., based on frequency, or alphabetically).",,,,
"While we now have a visualization capable of displaying a decently sized data, it cannot handle the sheer volume of all available news data.",,,,
"We are currently implementing an interface that generates manageable data structures on the basis of user queries from a triple store that contains massive event data from the processed news in RDF,(i.e.,"","",",,,,
possibly millions of news articles and billions of triples).,,,,
The user queries are translated into SPARQL requests and the resulting RDF is converted to the JSON input format.,,,,
"This solution requires that some structures, e.g. the climax score and the storylines, need to be computed beforehand.",,,,
"The user should make a visually supported selection overview, zoom and filter before querying the database to obtain all required data and displaying the current views.",,,,
"The NewsReader data exhibits various degrees of uncertainty and source perspectives on the event data (e.g. whether the source believes the event has actually happened, or whether it is a positive o,r neg,ative spe,""culation or expectation of the source).,""",,,,
These are modeled through the RDF representation as well but have not yet been considered in the tool.,,,,
"In the next version of the Storyteller application, we aim to visualize this data layer as well.",,,,
Feedback from domain experts who explored data from the three different use cases indicates that a proper understanding of the tool and the data is required in order to get meaningful results.,,,,
"In addition to developing tutorials that help researchers to get the most out of Storyteller, we propose two types of user studies.",,,,
"First, we need to evaluate Storyteller's usability.",,,,
"Second, we need to evaluate to what extent Storyteller generates results (data and views) that are useful for the different domains.",,,,
VIBES: Visualizing Changing Emotional States in Personal Stories ABSTRACT 1.,,,,
"INTRODUCTION Online journals (blogs) provide not only an outlet for emotional self-expression, but also a space for social interaction and commiseration through the exchange of personal stories.",,,,
"However, the massive extent of the blogosphere can overwhelm users, restricting their ability to make meaningful connections to fellow bloggers.",,,,
"In this article, we present a system, VIBES, that extracts the important topics from a blog, measures the emotions associated with those topics, and generates a suite of visualizations of this infor,matio,""n.,"",",,,,
"Unlike previous research, which has focused on extracting global trends in opinion across the blogosphere, VIBES focuses on depicting the emotional trajectories of the storylines that persist throug,hout,the life,""experiences of the individual.,""",,,,
"In user tests, a majority of participants agreed that the visualizations revealed the author's current emotional state and emotional development over time.",,,,
"VIBES has potential applications both in connecting users via shared emotional pro詮걄es on social networks, as well as facilitating self-re詮괻ction through private user status displays.",,,,
"It also o詮ers a fresh perspective for studying emotions and modeling how they change over time, which has a number of applications in a詮ective computing, including the creation of emotionally re,spons,ive inter,""faces.,""",,,,
"The ability to perceive, express, and manage emotions is an important aspect of being human.",,,,
"Psychologists have termed this ability ?쐃motional intelligence,??and it has recently become the focus of studies in the 詮갻lds of both human psychology as well as arti詮갷ial intelligence.",,,,
"Two key components of emotional intelligence - according to Daniel Goleman, one of the pioneering authors in the 詮갻ld - are self-awareness and social awareness.",,,,
"Respectively, these relate to the understanding of one's own emotions and the emotions of others [4].",,,,
Many believe that these skills are essential to success in life.,,,,
The growth of the internet has provided new tools for re詮걆ing these skills.,,,,
"The blog, which is essentially a public online diary, is one such medium.",,,,
"The author of a blog often writes about personal and emotional experiences, while the reader interprets and responds to these experiences.",,,,
"According to one psychologist, blogs provide the means for ?쐔he blogger to mobilize emotional support and reinforce a social identity??[27].",,,,
"For the blogger, therefore, the expression of emotion can be cathartic and may evoke empathy in the form of reader responses.",,,,
"Blog readers, on the other hand, may derive comfort from identifying with another's life experiences and may also improve their ability to understand and respond to emotional processes.",,,,
This can be especially bene詮갷ial when reading the blogs of those individuals in one's social network.,,,,
"Both parties, therefore, stand to develop emotional intelligence through participation in the blogosphere.",,,,
"A substantial number of people are in a position to take advantage of these opportunties, with 39% of adult internet users reading blogs and 12% writing in a blog [25].",,,,
"The number of blog authors is greater among online teenagers, with 28% keeping a blog [24].",,,,
"Accessing the rich emotional content of blogs, however, is not a simple process.",,,,
"For the reader, the sheer volume of blog entries makes navigating the blogosphere unwieldy.",,,,
The problem is similar for writers.,,,,
"While they may bene詮걎 from expressing their emotions, it is di詮긟ult for them to step back and assess their emotional patterns from the whole set of their entries.",,,,
There is an apparent need for a system that can harvest emotional data from a blog and present it to the people that may care about it.,,,,
"The goal of this work is the creation of such a system, VIBES1 , that harnesses the power of emotional expression in blogs in order to facilitate both self-re詮괻ction and the Categories and Subject,Desc,riptors H,"".3.5 [Online Information Services]: Web-based services; H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Information 詮걄tering General Terms Design, Human Factors Keywords Narrative, A詮ective Computing, Weblogs, Visualization, Summarization \x0cexchange of emotional intelligence among people.,""",,,,
"By extracting the topics and their accompanying storylines from a blog, measuring their emotional content automatically, and presenting the results to the user in a useful and meaningful way, VIBES,can h,elp users,""overcome information overload and access speci詮갷 emotional trajectories found in the life stories of others.,""",,,,
"Rather than seeking to represent the vox populi as other systems have, VIBES will preserve and amplify the voice of the individual.",,,,
VIBES generates visualizations that depict the emotional content from an individual blog in three di詮erent ways.,,,,
These visualizations can be placed in a public user pro詮걄e or displayed privately to the blogger.,,,,
"The existence of an audience for these visualizations is suggested by the popularity of online personality quizzes; people seem to have an a詮긪ity for tools that reveal information to them about th,emsel,""ves.,"",",,,,
"In addition, the visualizations o詮er a tool with which researchers can model ?쐃motional state transition??[31].",,,,
Knowledge of these emotional patterns can assist in building emotionally intelligent interfaces that sense and respond to emotional 詮굑ctuations in the user.,,,,
2,,,,
RELATED WORK There have been a number of systems that analyze changing sentiment across the blogosphere.,,,,
"These systems tend to search for trends in popular opinion about such topics as politicians, consumer products, and current events.",,,,
One such system is BlogPulse [22].,,,,
"Some of these global trend trackers only analyze the number of references to a given topic, while others also seek to analyze the positive or negative orientation of the reference.",,,,
MoodViews measures global mood levels across the LiveJournal user base and generates graphs to describe them.,,,,
"One of the MoodViews formats is Moodteller, which uses natural language processing and machine learning to predict moods based on language used and gets impressive accuracy [20].",,,,
There have also been systems that attempt to bring out the underlying emotional commonalities in diverse and otherwise unrelated bloggers.,,,,
"One such project is We Feel Fine, which groups blog excerpts that follow a form of the word ?쐄eel??with the same emotion [6].",,,,
"A similar project is The Dumpster, which does a similar text search for descriptions of romantic turmoil [3].",,,,
The surrounding text is analyzed in order to group break-ups with similar characteristics.,,,,
"In both We Feel Fine and The Dumpster, there is an artistic interactive interface to navigate through the excerpts.",,,,
These systems provide an overview of large groups of bloggers as well as access to individual voices.,,,,
"Most of these relevant past studies look for global trends across large numbers of bloggers, while VIBES focuses on changes concerning topics speci詮갷 to each individual.",,,,
"One similar system, Transient Life, provides a summarization of information about an individual's general state of life, which includes an emotional dimension [28].",,,,
"However, this system requires the user to explicitly talk about their thoughts and moods, while VIBES automatically gleans this data from something the user has already written, i.e.",,,,
the blog entries.,,,,
3,,,,
THE SYSTEM: VIBES We propose a system that combines and extends existing technologies in order to visualize the sentiments expressed by an individual blogger about speci詮갷 topics over time.,,,,
"The system, VIBES, is made up of four primary components: an entry parser, a topic identi詮갻r, an emotion classi詮갻r, and a set of visualizations (Figure 1).",,,,
"There are three visualization modes: EmoGraph, EmoMeters, and EmoCloud, each of which displays emotion and topic data in a di詮erent way.",,,,
"All of the visualization modes rely on the same basic underlying data collection processes, but they di詮er in exactly which data they use and the ways that they display this data.",,,,
The basic system works as follows (Figure 1).,,,,
"Given a LiveJournal username, the system retrieves all of the corresponding user's blog entries and identi詮갻s the topics from each entry.",,,,
"Then, the emotion classi詮갻r generates sentiment scores for the topics in the context of each entry.",,,,

A second reaction?봮ccasionally from the same people?봶as skepticism about the utility of the visualization.,,,,
"A third consistent theme, utility, usually came from people who identified as professionals in the field of social media marketing; they focused less on ?쐁oolness??and aesthetics, and much more on,the s,ystem's,""direct practical impact on their work.,""",,,,
"5.2 Social Media Analytics: A Common Use Case Subsequent online reactions provided evidence that Ripples found serious usage in the community of people who analyze social media as part of their busi,ness,practice.,"",""",,,,
The Year Sample was overwhelmingly made up of posts relating to business uses of Ripples.,,,,
"Of the 17 posts that were made more than a month after launch, 15 described business use cases, all in a positive light.",,,,
"For example, several months after launch, a Guardian article called Moore posted the same item to both Google+ and Facebook.",,,,
"He began by looking at engagement metrics, but then to get more detail on how his Google+ post spread, he looked at several views of a Ripples diagram.",,,,
"In each, he annotated his findings.",,,,

"In addition, the images were a key part of his narrative explaining his results.",,,,
"5.3 Summary of reactions Based on the public reaction, it seems that there are two sets of users who express interest in Ripples.",,,,
"First, in the immediate postlaunch periods, a highly visible set of people seemed to appreciate the visualization on the basis of aesthetics and novelty.",,,,
"A second more focused group is made of people who routinely analyze social media, typically for purposes of marketing and publicity.",,,,
"Within this group, we saw strong public enthusiasm, along with explanations (blog posts, YouTube videos, etc.)",,,,
of how they used the system.,,,,
"Encouragingly for the visualization technique itself, we did not uncover many comments complaining about understanding the diagrams.",,,,
"We saw discussion about the utility of the system, but few negative comments focused on the legibility of the diagrams themselves.",,,,
"Of course, this result could be biased by the selfselected nature of the people who wrote about Ripples; an interesting area for future work would be to verify the legibility of Ripples in a more co,ntrol,led setti,""ng.,""",,,,
6,,,,
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Google+ Ripples is a visualization of information flow on a social network.,,,,
"Unlike other systems with similar goals, Ripples is a native visualization?봳hat is, it exists as part of the system it visualizes, so that users can access it immediately and seamlessly.",,,,
"In addition to this unusual position in the user experience, Ripples illustrates a new visualization technique, a hybrid of a circular treemap and a traditional node-and-link tree diagram.",,,,
"This ?쐀alloon treemap??makes efficient use of space, while providing an easily understandable metaphor for the diffusion of information.",,,,
"User reaction to the visualization has been generally positive, with a strong reaction on social media sites.",,,,
"We have seen users invest significant effort in the tool, making many dozens of videos showing it in use, and writing detailed blog entries describing how analysts can gain benefits from it.",,,,
We have also seen that the tool has uncovered interesting patterns of information flow.,,,,
"Indeed, one important area for future work would be to use this new visualization technique, likely in conjunction with statistical analysis, to create models for information flow.",,,,
"In particular, it would be good to add quantitative analysis to our informal observations of different patterns.",,,,
"It is possible that these patterns may show how share tree topology can help predict virality of a post, or help classify content.",,,,
There is also room for additional research on the visualization technique.,,,,
"A significant amount of work and design went into creating a visualization technique that would scale to large share meanwhile, smaller share trees were sufficiently legible.",,,,
"Nonetheless, for relatively small trees (say, under 20 shares) the visualization doesn?셳 seem optimal.",,,,
"Indeed, for these situations some of our early designs, which showed very simple traditional tree structures, probably would have been clearer and more pleasing.",,,,
"One could imagine setting a threshold size, below which the simpler visualization is shown, but this could be confusing to users.",,,,
"It would be interesting to develop techniques that would ?쐓cale down??smoothly?봳hat is, that would allow the visualization to vary seamlessly between the circular treemap view at large scale, and,a tra,ditional,""tree view at a small one.,""",,,,
Creating a native visualization involves a significant engineering effort.,,,,
"Although there is an obvious advantage in having direct access to data, integrating with an existing system adds a huge layer of complexity to a visualization project.",,,,
"Nonetheless, our experience suggests that creating a native visualization is worthwhile, and that users will welcome even an elaborate visualization if it appears in a familiar, convenient context.,"","",,",,,,
Our hope is that in other systems visualization can make a move from an ?쏿dd-on??to an intrinsic part of the system.,,,,
Watch the Story Unfold with TextWheel: Visualization of Large-Scale News Streams Keyword-based searching and clustering of news articles have been widely used for news analysis.,,,,
"However, news articles usually have other attributes such as source, author, date and time, length, and sentiment which should be taken into account.",,,,
"In addition, news articles and keywords have complicated macro/micro relations, which include relations between news articles (i.e., macro relation), relations between keywords (i.e., micro relation,""), an"",d relatio,""ns between news articles and keywords (i.e., macro-micro relation).,""",,,,
These macro/micro relations are time varying and pose special challenges for news analysis.,,,,

INTRODUCTION News articles are a major source of information.,,,,
"For topics such as major companies, famous people, and major events, the volume of news articles is enormous and reading them one by one becomes impossible.",,,,
News visualization turns news streams into visual forms and shows them to users so they can use their prior knowledge and highbandwidth visual processing capacity to gain insight into the data.,,,,
There are three major issues facing news stream visualization.,,,,
"First, news streams are time-varying high-dimensional data.",,,,
It is a classic hard problem to develop \x0cvisual encoding schemes for keywords and articles to show their multivariate and timevarying nature.,,,,
"Second, there may exist complex macro/micro relations between keywords and articles.",,,,
"At the micro level, keywords (e.g., Bill Gates and Microsoft) have various relations.",,,,
"At the macro level, text articles may be also related (e.g., dealing with the same topic).",,,,
"Meanwhile, each article contains multiple keywords and each keyword likely appears in many articles; these relations may change with time.",,,,
These complex macro/micro relations may be very useful for text analysis.,,,,
"However, it is very difficult to visually encode these macro/micro relations.",,,,
"Third, text data can be extremely large and this poses special challenges for the scalability of visual encoding schemes.",,,,
In this article we develop a visual analytics system for news streams and address the aforementioned issues facing news visualization.,,,,
We focus on the multiple attributes of news articles and the dynamic relations between articles and keywords.,,,,
"Our visualization system is built on top of a text mining preprocessing, and consists of three components: significance trend chart generation, entity encoding, and rela-tion encoding.",,,,
"During the preprocessing stage, keywords are extracted with various attributes (e.g., sentiment and frequency), and the relations between keywords and news articles are also established.",,,,
"With the help of modern text mining techniques, we may find a number of interesting or important keywords as candidates for further explorations.",,,,
"In return, our visualization system could also help users verify the keywords picked by an automatic algorithm, and further gain insights into the content of the news streams.",,,,
"After that, all the sentiment and word frequency information is collected and summarized as a line chart, which we call the significance trend chart, to provide an overview of the sentiment evolutio,n ove,""r time.,"",",,,,
"At the same time, we use a concise glyph to encode each article whose multiple high-level attributes are first extracted and then encoded using different visual channels of the glyph to provide a su,ccinc,t overvie,""w of the article.,""",,,,
"To deal with the complex macro/micro relations existing among keywords and articles, we introduce a novel visual primitive called TextWheel which consists of one or multiple keyword wheels, a docume,nt tr,ansportat,""ion belt, and chains to connect the belt and wheels (see Figure 1).,""",,,,
"By observing the TextWheel and its content changes, interesting patterns can be detected.",,,,
"Designed after some familiar objects in our life, \x0cthe TextWheel is intuitive to use.",,,,
We also provide a set of interaction tools to help users better use our system to analyze large-scale news corpora.,,,,
The major contributions of this article are as follows.,,,,
"??We present a visual analytics system for users to visually summarize, organize, abstract, and analyze news streams and other text documents.",,,,
"Our system brings multiple attributes of text documents, dynamic relations between text documents and keywords, micro relations among keywords, and macro relations among documents into one coherent,analy,tical con,""text.,""",,,,
??We design text glyphs to visually encode keywords and documents.,,,,
The glyph can intuitively and succinctly summarize various nominal and categorical features of keywords and documents.,,,,
??We develop a novel visualization primitive called TextWheel representing the complicated macro/micro relations among keywords and documents.,,,,
2,,,,
RELATED WORK Text visualization has received considerable research interest in recent years.,,,,
Various visualization approaches have been proposed to help people effectively analyze and understand large document archives.,,,,
These techniques can be generally grouped into two categories: document visualization and semantic visualization.,,,,
2.1.,,,,
Document Visualization Document visualization techniques concentrate on visualizing large document corpora and illustrating relations between documents.,,,,
"Most of the techniques are designed to analyze similarity relations among documents by transforming each document into a feature vector (usually a keyword vector) and then measuring distances betwee,n the,se vector,""s.,""",,,,
"Based on the resulting similarity, these documents are clustered and then displayed either in a hierarchical way [Granitzer et al. 2004] or in a unstructured way [Wise 1999].",,,,
"For example, the SPIRE system [Wise 1999] displayed documents as dots on a 2D plane and clustered them based on their keywords.",,,,
Documents that are close in the high-dimensional space will also be close on the 2D plane.,,,,
"In 2005, Hetzler et al. [2005] further extended this system to the temporal domain and used it to analyze dynamic document flows.",,,,
InfoSky [Granitzer et al. 2004] uses a similar approach to visualize hierarchical document collections on a plane space.,,,,
"Users can zoom in and out, just like using a telescope, to explore the documents at different levels of detail.",,,,
"However, InfoSky requires that the documents have already been organized into a hierarchical structure.",,,,
"Different from these two approaches, HiPP [Paulovich and Minghim 2008] can automatically cluster documents into a multi-level structure and allow users to dynamically change the hierarchical structu,re du,ring the,""exploration.,""",,,,
2.2.,,,,
Semantic Visualization Semantic visualization techniques focus on revealing and analyzing the semantic patterns in documents.,,,,
"Based on the different types of patterns they want to explore, these techniques can be categorized into three groups: literal patterns, keyword patterns, and temporal patterns.",,,,
Literal Patterns.,,,,
Word Tree [Wattenberg and Vie?gas 2008] uses trie-like structures to explore word collocation patterns in real documents.,,,,
"In the tree structure, nodes represent words with size encoding the word frequency.",,,,
An edge linking two nodes indicates that these two words are concatenated in the original document.,,,,
"Phrase Nets [van Ham et al. 2009], which can be considered as a follow up work of Word Tree, also uses links to indicate collocation relations.",,,,
"However, it connect words as a graph instead of a \x0ctree to convey more sophisticated relations.",,,,
Mao et al. [2007] developed a technique to visualize the sequential semantic progress in documents.,,,,
"They used statistical methods to identify patterns within the input document data, and then fitted the patterns to a curve.",,,,
Oelke et al. [2008] applied text fingerprinting on the input text document and provided users with a loopback framework to evaluate and improve the visualization results.,,,,
Keyword Patterns.,,,,
BlogPulse [Glance et al. 2004] monitors over 5.5 million Web blogs and records more than 450K posts every day.,,,,
"To assist users, it provides a Web search interface (http://www.blogpulse.com/) for keywords.",,,,
It uses a line chart to show the keyword frequency so that users can see how one or multiple keywords appear and disappear over time.,,,,
Wong et al. [1999] combined the strength of text mining techniques and 3D bar charts to visualize the association rules within multiple items.,,,,
They used the x-axis to display rules and the y-axis to list items.,,,,
"Then, an association rule can be visualized as a 3D bar standing on the x-y plane.",,,,
The Jigsaw system [Stasko et al. 2008] provides a visual interface for users to search different keywords in a large collection of documents.,,,,
"It focuses on the relations between different types of keywords, such as people, organizations, and places.",,,,
Temporal Patterns.,,,,
Temporal patterns are also a very active research field in document analysis.,,,,
Some papers try to track the trend of text flows and identify their changes over time.,,,,
"For example, Wong et al. [2003] proposed a method to visualize dynamic data streams by using animated scatterplots.",,,,
Allan et al. [2005] also developed a technique to identify evolving stories and new stories by analyzing a growing set of news articles.,,,,
ThemeRiver [Havre et al. 2000] uses stacked area charts to visualize a collection of documents according to their themes.,,,,
"In the chart, each color stripe represents a theme and is curved smoothly to make it look like a river.",,,,
Some other papers focus on the cluster or entity relation evolutions in document streams.,,,,
"For example, Erten et al. [2004] combined graph visualization and clustering techniques to analyze how the coauthor relations evolve over time in scientific literature.",,,,
TextPool [AlbrechtBuehler et al. 2005] clusters document contents on the screen and uses carefully designed animations to help users understand the content changes.,,,,
"Compared with these previous approaches, our article addresses a quite different problem, that is, how to visualize the macro/micro relations widely existing in news streams and other text data.",,,,
3,,,,
DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING 3.1.,,,,
"Data Collection All experiments in this article were conducted on a 1.5 gigabyte corpus of 333,289 news articles published between 2004 and 2006, with an interesting pedigree.",,,,
"Our experiments in this article are run over subsets of documents selected from this corpus on the basis of a single keyword, say Merck or Verizon and the resulting set of several thousand articles,visua,""lized.,"",",,,,
We believe this procedure is quite representative of typical tasks concerning corpus understanding.,,,,
3.2.,,,,
Named Entity Recognition Named entity recognition is a natural language processing problem where one seeks to detect every named entity mentioned in a document.,,,,
"It serves as our feature extraction system for documents, identifying the topics of likely potential interest.",,,,
"Named entity recognition is a well-studied problem with an extensive literature (e.g., Chieu and Ng [2002] and McDonald [1993]).",,,,
"We primarily employ rule-based \x0ctechniques that are not vastly different from those in the literature, although they require substantial engineering to achieve good performance.",,,,
"Here we present the most important phases of our named entity recognition procedure, namely part-of-speech tagging, syntactic tagging, proper noun classification, rules processing, alias expansion a,nd ge,ographic,""normalization.,""",,,,
Part of Speech Tagging.,,,,
"To extract proper noun phrases from text, we tag each input word with an appropriate part-of-speech tag (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)",,,,
on the basis of statistical predication and local rules.,,,,
Part-of-speech tagging requires that the input text be properly partitioned into sentences.,,,,
This can be readily done using cues from capitalization and punctuation.,,,,
We employ a popular Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagger [Brill 1994] in our analysis.,,,,
"Such taggers are based on large vocabularies and collections of tagging rules, and require a substantial amount of time to initialize internal data structures.",,,,
Syntactic Tagging.,,,,
"Here we employ regular-expression patterns to markup certain classes of important text features such as dates, numbers, and unit-tagged quantities.",,,,
Proper Noun Phrase Classi詮갷ation.,,,,
"Each proper noun phrase in a text belongs to some semantic class, such as person, city, or company.",,,,
"In this phase of our pipeline we employ gazetteer (e.g., popular first and last names provided by the U.S. Census Bureau)1 and Bayesian method [Mitchell 1997] to classify each identified phrase.",,,,
Rules Processing.,,,,
Compound entities are difficult to handle correctly.,,,,
"For example, the entity name State University of New York, Stony Brook spans both a comma and an uncapitalized word that is not a proper noun.",,,,
"By comparison, China, Japan, and Korea refers to these three entities.",,,,
Our solution was to implement a small set (??60) of hand-crafted rules to properly handle such exceptions.,,,,
Alias Expansion.,,,,
"A single entity is often described by several different proper noun phrases, for example, President Kennedy, John Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, and JFK, even in the same document.",,,,
We identify several common classes of aliasing and take appropriate steps to unify such representations into a single set.,,,,
Geographic Normalization.,,,,
Geographic names can be ambiguous.,,,,
"For example, Albany is both the capital of New York State and a similarly-sized city in Georgia.",,,,
"However, auxiliary information can be useful in resolving this ambiguity.",,,,
"We developed a geographic normalization routine that identifies where places are mentioned, resolves any ambiguity using population and location information, and replaces the name with a normalized,,unam,biguous r,""epresentation.,""",,,,
3.3.,,,,
"Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis of natural language texts is a large and growing field, surveyed in Pang and Lee [2008].",,,,
Previous work falls naturally in two groups.,,,,
The first relates to techniques to automatically generate sentiment lexicons.,,,,
The second relates to systems that analyze sentiment (on a global or local basis) for entire documents.,,,,
"Newspapers and blogs express opinion of news entities (people, places, things) while reporting on recent events.",,,,
We have developed a method [Bautin et al. 2010; Lloyd et al. 2005] that assigns scores indicating positive or negative opinion to each distinct \x0centity in the text corpus.,,,,
"The method is also used in this system for estimating sentiment scores for entities, and evaluates entity polarity as 3.4.",,,,
"Co-Occurrence Analysis To determine the significance of the co-occurrence of two entities, we bound the probability that two entities co-occur in more articles if occurrences were generated by a ran,dom p,""rocess.,"",",,,,
To estimate this probability we use a Chernoff Bound.,,,,
We have where 灌 measures how far above the expected value the random variable is.,,,,
"If we set (1 + 灌)E[X ] = F = number of co-occurrences, and consider X as the number of randomized juxtapositions, we can bound the probability that we observe at least F juxtapositions by calculati,ng wh,ere E[X ],""= naNnb , N = number of sentences in the corpus, na = number of occurrences of entity a, and nb = number of occurrences of entity b, as the juxtaposition score for a pair of entities.,""",,,,
4,,,,
"SIGNIFICANCE TREND CHART After the data collection and processing, all the sentiment and word frequency information is obtained.",,,,
"However, directly going through them one by one seems unwise because there are so many keywords in the document corpus.",,,,
"In this section, we introduce the significance trend chart, which is inspired by entropy and information theory, to analyze and visually summarize changes of sentiment and word frequency information,alon,g the who,""le document stream.,""",,,,
"According to entropy and information theory, if an object contains more exclusive information, it is more significant.",,,,
"Following this idea, we design a novel method to measure the significance value for a document in the document sequence.",,,,
"we define that a document is more significant if it has more exclusive sentiment and word frequency information compared with its neighboring (preceding or succeeding) documents in the document stre,""am.,"",,",,,,
4.1.,,,,
"Entropy, Mutual Information, and Conditional Entropy First of all, we briefly introduce several important information theory concepts which are used in our significance trend chart method.",,,,
"For more details about entropy and information theory, interested readers can refer to the book Cover and Thomas [2006].",,,,
The first concept is information entropy.,,,,
"For a discrete random variable X , its entropy value can be calculated as \x0cwhere X has n possible values {x1 , 쨌 쨌 쨌 , xn}, and p(x) is the marginal probability distribution function of X .",,,,
"The higher the entropy value, the more uniform the marginal probabilities.",,,,
"The entropy is maximized as log n when every marginal probability xi equals to 1n , which means X has maximum information.",,,,
"The second concept is mutual information, which is the measure of the dependence (i.e., the shared information in the information theory point of view) between two discrete random variables, for exa,mple,X and Y .,"",""",,,,
"The mutual information H(X ; Y ) between X and Y is calculated as where X has n possible values {x1 , 쨌 쨌 쨌 , xn}, and Y has m possible values {y1 , 쨌 쨌 쨌 , ym}.",,,,
"p(x, y) is the joint probability function.",,,,
p(x) and p(y) are the marginal probabilities of X and Y respectively.,,,,
"H(X ; Y ) equals zero if and only if X and Y are independent, which means X and Y share no information.",,,,
The last concept is conditional entropy.,,,,
The conditional entropy H(X |Y ) of a random variable X given another random variable Y is the measure of the amount of information contained by X but not by Y .,,,,
"It can be calculated as From the definition, we can see that H(X |Y ) is nonnegative.",,,,
"It equals zero if and only if X and Y share everything (i.e., they are identical).",,,,
"On the other hand, it has maximum value H(X ), when X and Y are independent (i.e., H(X ; Y ) = 0).",,,,
4.2.,,,,
"Information-Theoretic Signi詮갷ance Calculation To estimate the significance for every document in the stream, we need to calculate its conditional entropy value given its neighboring documents.",,,,
"First, we calculate the average sentiment towards every tagged word in the document.",,,,
"After that, a histogram is built to summarize the sentiment information distribution.",,,,
"For example, we find the maximum and minimum average sentiments in a document X , then set 32 intervals between these two values.",,,,
Each interval in the histogram counts the number of words that fall into it.,,,,
"Then the information entropy H(X ) of the document can be computed as i=1 where N is the bin number, and counti and count X indicate the word count in the ith bin and the whole document X , respecti,vely.,"","",",,,,
"Similarly, given another document Y , the mutual entropy H(X |Y ) of document X can be calculated using a two-dimensional histogram.",,,,
"Finally, we estimate the significance value S(X t) of document X t at time t to be the average value of its conditional entropy values given its preceding document X t?? and succeeding document X t+,""1 , t"",""hat is, \"",""x0c5.,""",,,,
"SYSTEM OVERVIEW Figure 1 shows the interface of our TextWheel visualization system with all its main visual components: a significance trend chart, a document transportation belt, and one or multipl,e key,word whee,""ls.,""",,,,
These three components provide users with three levels of views of details in the document stream.,,,,
The line chart at the bottom is the significance trend chart.,,,,
It shows the highest level of view by depicting the sentiment changes extracted from a document stream.,,,,
The x-axis encodes the time and the y-axis encodes the significance value of the documents.,,,,
"On the upper right, a U-shape document transportation belt shows users a small portion of documents in the whole stream.",,,,
Each glyph on the belt represents one or multiple documents.,,,,
"When users interact with our system, the document glyphs are transported along the belt.",,,,
"When a new document glyph enters the focus region (the semicircular part of the belt), it is highlighted in red.",,,,
We also put a sliding bar on the significance trend chart to show the location of the highlighted document glyph in the whole document stream.,,,,
Users can also drag the sliding bar to synchronize the transportation belt and the significance trend chart.,,,,
"For example, when users interact with the transportation belt (e.g., speeding up the transportation or reversing the direction of the transportation), the bar can show users which part of the data s,tream,the belt,""is currently showing.,""",,,,
"On the other hand, users can also directly drag the sliding bar on the chart to a chosen time of the document stream; the belt will automatically roll forward or backward to show the documents at th,at ti,""me.,"",",,,,
We also encode the macro relations between documents on the chart.,,,,
"By drawing arcs from the sliding bar, all the documents which are most related to the highlighted document are pointed out on the whole document stream.",,,,
On the upper left are one or multiple wheels that show different keywords users are interested in.,,,,
"To encode the micro relations between keywords, we put keywords uniformly on a circle and then use lines to indicate the relations between keywords.",,,,
The keyword wheels also interact with all the documents in the focus area (the semicircular part of the transportation belt) by connecting them with some chains.,,,,
6,,,,
"TEXTWHEEL Our TextWheel system consists of several visual components, which are all inspired by some everyday objects that users are very familiar with.",,,,
"For example, our keyword wheel is inspired by Ferris wheels.",,,,
News articles move along the transportation belt just like baggage moving along the conveyor belt.,,,,
"By drawing experience from our everyday life, our system has obvious metaphors and is intuitive to use.",,,,
"In this section, we introduce the design details for each component.",,,,
6.1.,,,,
Entity Encoding with Glyphs There are two major entities in our data: keyword and document.,,,,
Both of them have multiple attributes.,,,,
Keyword Glyph.,,,,
"As keywords have been widely used in Web pages, some visual encoding schemes have been well established.",,,,
"For example, the Google Visualization API can allow users to use size and color to encode various attributes of keywords.",,,,
"Usually, the font size of a keyword represents the frequency of the keyword appearing in a document.",,,,
We adopt this scheme in our system.,,,,
Figure 2(a) shows the word cloud generated by the Google Visualization API.,,,,
These keywords are later arranged into a circular frame called keyword wheel (see Figure 2(b)) in our system.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
2,,,,
Glyphs: (a) Keyword cloud generated by the Google Visualization API; (b) keyword wheel; (c) the document glyph for one article.,,,,
Document Glyph.,,,,
"We adopt a simple rectangular shape glyph in our current system, though other more complicated glyphs can also be used.",,,,
The width of the rectangle encodes the average number of keywords while the height indicates the article length.,,,,
The color of the glyph encodes the average sentiment expressed in an article.,,,,
Figure 2(c) illustrates the document glyphs used in our system.,,,,
6.2.,,,,
Document Transportation Belts Layout.,,,,
"We adopt a U-shape layout for our belt because the U-shape belt can provide more space for the layout of documents and better convey the ?쐃ndless??feeling about news streams, considering there usua,lly a,re much m,""ore documents than keywords.,""",,,,
"In addition, the U-turn can naturally divide the document belt into three parts and give a nice focus+overview view.",,,,
"The curved part serves as a focus region, in which the keywords are connected to the documents that fall into this region, while the top and bottom straight parts give users a bigger picture about w,hat h,ave just,""left and what are coming.,""",,,,
Speed.,,,,
The speed of the belt is highly controllable.,,,,
We can directly drag the sliding bar on the significance trend chart to roll the transportation belt forward or backward to any time points we are interested in.,,,,
"We also set a uniform or automatically computed speed for the transportation belt, so we can see the belt rolling automatically.",,,,
"If we find something interesting, we can stop the belt or lower the speed to allow more time for inspection.",,,,
Order of documents.,,,,
The documents can come into the transportation belt with different orders.,,,,
"By default, they are arranged by time.",,,,
Other orders are also possible.,,,,
"For example, the documents from the same sources can come together.",,,,
6.3.,,,,
Keyword Wheels The keyword glyphs are put in the keyword wheels.,,,,
The relation between two keywords is encoded by simply connecting them with a line.,,,,
"Meanwhile, the sentiment change of the keywords can be naturally revealed by the rotation of the wheel.",,,,
Keyword selection.,,,,
We select the most relevant keywords according to user interest or recommended during data preprocessing.,,,,
Every keyword glyph on the same wheel is assigned with one unique background color.,,,,
"Therefore, users are not suggested to choose more than 20 keywords for one wheel.",,,,
"Otherwise, the colors may become difficult to differentiate.",,,,
"In case users have an actual need to show more than 20 keywords, they can put them in different wheels.",,,,
Keyword position.,,,,
Keywords will be uniformly positioned in the circular frame of the keyword wheel.,,,,
Their positions are computed based on their inter-relations.,,,,
We use a greedy algorithm to position keywords and the keyword appearing most frequently in \x0cthe documents will be put at the center of the circular segment falling into the focus window.,,,,
Then other keywords can be positioned accordingly.,,,,
Keyword update.,,,,
As the documents in the focus window change gradually some keywords may become more or less frequent or even disappear from the documents in the focus window.,,,,
"When a keyword becomes more frequent, the glyph size becomes bigger, and vise versa.",,,,
"When a keyword disappears from the documents in the focus window, it is still kept on the wheel, but its background color will disappear, so that it will not cause much distraction to users.",,,,
6.4.,,,,
Dynamic System We further connect the keyword wheel and document transportation belt with chains to form a dynamic system.,,,,
A keyword is likely contained in multiple documents while every document holds different sentiments towards it.,,,,
"Once a document enters the focus window, a chain is connected to the document with all the related keywords in the keyword wheel.",,,,
"The width, color, and opacity of the chain can encode various attributes of the relation between the document and the keyword.",,,,
"For example, we can use the width to encode the strength of the sentiment and use the color to indicate what word this sentiment is about.",,,,
There are two hubs between the keyword wheel and the transportation belt.,,,,
Every chain will go to one of them first.,,,,
"All the chains indicating positive sentiments go to the lower hub, while all the chains indicating negative sentiments go to the upper hub.",,,,
"At each hub, all the chains with sentiments towards the same keywords (i.e., all the chains with the same color) are bundled together.",,,,
Then the bundled chains connect to the keyword wheel to drag the wheel to rotate.,,,,
"We assume both bundled chains have attractive forces on the wheel, and the force values are proportional to the bundle size.",,,,
"Therefore, if the sum of negative sentiments towards to all the keywords is stronger than the sum of positive sentiments, the wheel will rotate clockwise in our system, and vise versa.",,,,
6.5.,,,,
User Interaction We provide a set of interaction tools to help users better use our system to deal with a very large number of news articles.,,,,
Some of these tools are summarized as follows.,,,,
??System configuration.,,,,
Our system is highly configurable.,,,,
"The size of the wheel and belt, the order of the documents in the belt, and the encoding schemes are all configurable.",,,,
Our system allows users to deploy multiple keyword wheels in the display.,,,,
Each wheel may represent a separate group of keywords.,,,,
??Speed control.,,,,
"Users can pause, fast forward, or rewind the belt.",,,,
Users can also set a time for the whole stream and then the speed will be automatically computed.,,,,
??Coordinated view.,,,,
Users can link document glyphs in the TextWheel view with the real documents by simply clicking the glyph icons.,,,,
"Users can also click on a single edge connecting two keyword glyphs, then a line chart will pop up to show the correlation evolution between these two keywords over time.",,,,
??Filtering.,,,,
Filtering is available to show a small set of articles that users are interested in.,,,,
"There is a control panel beside the visualization display for users to filter out some news articles by date, size, source, etc.",,,,
??Clustering and highlighting.,,,,
Users can also cluster the documents or cluster the chains in the window region to reduce clutter.,,,,
"If users still cannot see individual chains in the focus region, they could also click a document glyph, and all the related chains and keywords will be highlighted accordingly.",,,,
6.6.,,,,
Alternative Designs We have considered some other designs for our TextWheel system.,,,,
"For example, the transportation belt can also be a wheel or a straight belt.",,,,
We have also considered putting the keywords in another straight or U-shape belt.,,,,
"The wheel-shape transportation belt does not work in our system, since not all documents can be positioned on the wheel.",,,,
The straight belt is a better choice.,,,,
But the U-shape belt looks more consistent with the keyword wheels.,,,,
"Moreover, since we may occasionally want to explore relations between document glyphs, it is much easier to draw edges inside a U-shape belt than on a straight belt.",,,,
"However, the movement of the keywords looks strange compared with the rotation of the keyword wheel.",,,,
The wheel could also encode the micro relation between keywords more effectively.,,,,
"In addition, using different primitives for keywords and documents may avoid confusing these two different entities.",,,,
"For the dynamic system, we have considered directly connecting the keyword glyphs with document glyphs, or to directly use a physical spring model on the keyword wheel.",,,,
"However, they are too distracting and hard for users to focus on what they are really interested in.",,,,
"Thus we decided to simplify the design, such as grouping all the chains first before they connect to the wheel, and fix all the keyword glyphs on the wheel before further exploration.",,,,
7,,,,
CASE STUDY We have applied our system to the news streams mentioned in Section 3.1.,,,,
"The news streams are related to six major topics: Microsoft, Sony, NYSE, Merck, China, and Verizon.",,,,
Each topic contains thousands of news articles from various sources.,,,,
We first ran our system for each topic and did some initial screening.,,,,
"Once we found interesting patterns, we configured the system and fine-tuned the visual displays to bring out more details for analysis.",,,,
"In this section, we describe two findings.",,,,
"The following encoding schemes were used in all experiments: the keyword size encodes the frequency (larger size means higher frequency); the document glyph represents all the articles in one day; t,he do,cument gl,""yph height encodes the average length of all the articles in that day (larger height means longer length); the document glyph width encodes the number of articles (larger width means more articles); the document glyph color encodes the average number of keywords mentioned in all the articles (darker color means larger number); the width of the lines in the keyword wheel encodes the strength of the co-occurrence (thicker line means higher co-occurrence); the arcs in the significance chart indicate the places having the documents most similar to the document at the sliding bar (thicker arc means higher similarity); the color of a line linking a wheel and a document encodes which keyword the document has sentiment towards (connecting to the upper part of a wheel means the sentiment is negative, and connecting to the lower part of a wheel means the sentiment is positive).,""",,,,
All the experiments are conducted on a Macbook Pro with Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2 GHz CPUs and 2GB memory.,,,,
"With some preprocessing, our system can handle thousands of news articles in real time.",,,,
7.1.,,,,
"Verizon's Acquiring MCI During the initial screening of the news streams related to Verizon, we noticed some interesting relations between Verizon and MCI.",,,,
Sometimes these two keywords are quite large in the display and dominate the view.,,,,
"Meanwhile, there is a thick line linking them (see Figures 3(b) and 3(d)).",,,,
"Sometimes, the MCI keyword totally disappears from the documents in the focus window (i.e., MCI background color disappears) (see Figures 3(a) and 3(c)).",,,,
"Thus, we decided to focus on this situation and try figure out what happens.",,,,
Figure 3 shows some screen shots of the exploration.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
3,,,,
The story of Verizon's merger with MCI.,,,,
"From Figure 3(a), we can see that the MCI keyword has not appeared in the keyword wheel before January 2005.",,,,
"Then around February 2005, MCI starts to appear in the keyword wheel and the line linking the Verizon glyph and the MCI glyph is quite thick (see Figure 3(b)).",,,,
"In all the document glyphs which have links with both MCI and Verizon keywords, we noticed that there is one that has green color, high height, and very thin width (highlighted by a red rectangle in,Figu,""re 3(b)),"",""which indicates that it only contains one long article mentioning both keywords many times.,""",,,,
We opened that glyph and read the document.,,,,
"After quickly going through this article, we found this paragraph: ?쏮CI Inc. confirmed an agreement to be acquired by Verizon Communications in a deal with a total value of $6746000000.??This expla,ins t,he reason,""that these two companies became hot topics and were frequently mentioned together.,""",,,,
"Then around October 2005, the link connecting MCI and Verizon disappears (see Figure 3(c)).",,,,
We believed that the merging of these two companies was no longer a hot topic.,,,,
"However, around December 2005, the thick link between these two glyphs shows up again (see Figure 3(d)).",,,,
"So we paused, and chose the only glyph that has links to both MCI and Verizon (highlighted by a red rectangle in Figure 3(d)).",,,,
"There are only two documents in that glyph, and one of them mentioned that ?쏺erizon Communications, Inc., has completed its acquisition of MCI.",,,,
"MCI's assets will be folded into a new Verizon unit called Verizon Business.??From this case study, we can see that our system can help users quickly identify the relations between keywords and the,n nar,row down,""to some articles to find the reasons for these relations.,""",,,,
7.2.,,,,
"Merck and Its Troublesome Drug Vioxx For the news streams related to Merck, we divided the keywords into two groups, that is, company and drug.",,,,
"During the initial exploration, we noticed that a drug called Vioxx appears frequently in the display and the sentiment towards it changes \x0cdramatically in 2004 from neutral to bad.",,,,
Then we reran the system and paid special attention to this drug.,,,,
Figure 4 shows some screen shots.,,,,
"According to Figure 4(a), Vioxx has not appeared in the drug keyword wheel around August 23, 2004.",,,,
"Then on August 30, Vioxx shows up and the sentiment towards it is quite negative (see Figure 4(b)).",,,,
We followed the thickest link from the Vioxx glyph and identified a document glyph representing articles on August 26 (highlighted by a red rectangle in Figure 4(b)).,,,,
This document glyph is slim because it only has one article from the AFX UK Focus on that day.,,,,
This article says: ?쏛nalysis of a study on the safety of COX-2 inhibitors found that Vioxx doses above 25 milligrams per day tripled the risk of cardiovascular events...??,,,,
"Therefore, we can see that the negative sentiment towards Merck, the maker of Vioxx, is slightly stronger than the positive sentiment (highlighted by blue rectangles in Figure 4(b)).",,,,
"Both Merck and Vioxx remain stable until September, when Vioxx becomes much more negative (see Figure 4(c)).",,,,
We found the glyph with the thickest links to Merck and Vioxx (highlighted by a red rectangle in Figure 4(c)) and retrieved the corresponding articles (two documents in total).,,,,
"One article from AFX International Focus mentioned that ?쏮erck said Merck was withdrawing its Vioxx arthritis drug from shelves worldwide, resulting in a 50 cent to 60 cent reduction in per-share e,arnin,gs.??We t,""hen followed the thickest arc on the significance trend chart to reveal similar news articles from the same source (highlighted by a blue rectangle in Figure 4(c)).,""",,,,
"This article also said something negative about Merck: ?쏮erck slumped more than 5 percent and was the biggest percentage loser among Dow Jones Industrial Average components.??Finally, Vioxx is no l,onger,a hot to,""pic because it becomes small in size and often without any background color (see Figure 4(d)), which means it is not mentioned by any documents in the focus window.,""",,,,
"This case study demonstrates that the sentiments expressed by the keyword glyphs are very useful in news analysis and with the macro/micro relation information provided by our system we can quickly,ident,ify the s,""ources of these sentiments.,""",,,,
8,,,,
"USER STUDY In addition to the case study, we also conducted an informal user study consisting of 12 college students.",,,,
"They were all year two students having no prior information visualization knowledge, each of whom was asked to use our system and answer three questions.",,,,
"Before attempting the study, the users were briefly introduced to our system.",,,,
"Meanwhile, they were also encouraged to play with it using different configurations such that they could get more familiar with our visual encodings.",,,,
"To perform the case study, we chose a fraction (718 documents in a half year) of the data used in the second case study as the testing data.",,,,
Then we processed the data and picked the top 12 frequently mentioned companies from the documents.,,,,
"After that, the document corpus, along with all 12 company names, was loaded into our system.",,,,
"The documents on the transportation belt were grouped by day, and all 12 companies were placed in the same wheel.",,,,
"Then, we presented this system to the users and asked them to finish three tasks.",,,,
These tasks are mainly designed to test the efficiency of the encoding scheme of the macro/micro relations.,,,,
(The effectiveness of macro/micro relation encoding scheme is demonstrated in the case study.),,,,
The first task is designed to test the efficiency of our sentiment encoding scheme.,,,,
"In this task, the users need to find out the time when a specific company on the wheel reaches its largest positive sentiment.",,,,
The second task is designed to test the efficiency of the relation encoding scheme.,,,,
"In this task, they are asked to discern which two companies have the strongest relationship in the whole document stream.",,,,
The last task combines these two previous tasks.,,,,
"In this task, we challenge them to find out the company that has a very positive sentiment and still has a relatively strong relation with a specific keyword.",,,,
"In each task, we recorded their answers and the response time they needed to finish it.",,,,
The results are shown in Figure 5.,,,,
"For the first task, ten users generally found the correct time (with average error of 5.5 days), while the remaining two users found the time that was also a local peak of positive sentiment with th,e sec,ond large,""st value in the whole stream.,""",,,,
The average response time is 35 seconds.,,,,
"However, we also noticed that the standard deviation is as big as 21 seconds (see Figure 5(a)), which is probably because some of the users were still not quite familiar with our system.",,,,
The first task is designed to warm up the subjects.,,,,
"It does not demonstrate the advantages of our system, since a classical line chart may be better for this task.",,,,
"Therefore, we asked the subject to finish two more complicated tasks, in which our system may better show its advantages.",,,,
"The second task is a little harder than the first one, since users may need \x0cto track multiple keywords at the same time.",,,,
"This time, eight users found the correct pair with an average response time of 49 seconds, which is a little longer than that in the first task.",,,,
"However, the standard deviation is reduced to 18 seconds.",,,,
"The final task is the most difficult one, because it requires users to synthesize two different visual encodings and keep the results in mind such that they could find the most appropriate one in th,e who,le stream,"".,""",,,,
"However, the result seems quite satisfactory.",,,,
"Since our system includes a sliding bar for quickly rolling the transport belt forward and backward, users can freely examine the documents at any speed they like.",,,,
Ten users found the correct one with an average response time of 68 seconds.,,,,
"On the other hand, the standard deviation is further reduced to 15 seconds.",,,,
"All of the three examples demonstrate that, with a little training, most users can use our system to explore large news streams and correctly find some patterns in the testing data for the three tas,""ks.,"",,",,,,
"On the other hand, classical line charts are not suitable for the remaining two tasks.",,,,
"Since it needs to generate a curve for each pair of keywords, users may be easily overwhelmed when there are many keywords to explore.",,,,
"After they finished all three tasks, we also asked the users about their general feeling about our design.",,,,
The biggest concern we had before conducting the user study was the visual clutter and distraction in the interface.,,,,
"However, the responses to our system from users are quite enthusiastic.",,,,
"Overall, they feel the system is informative, intuitive, and visually appealing.",,,,
"In particular, they think that the visual interface is well organized, and each of the visual component has a very clear purpose, which makes the exploration easy.",,,,
We also asked their opinions for each visual component.,,,,
"Most of them appreciate the familiar metaphors, such as wheels, belts, and chains, to intuitively represent document streams and sophisticated relations involving documents, keywords, and sentiment,value,""s.,"",",,,,
"Among all the visual elements, the users appreciate the wheel most, because it combines multiple aspects of information in a natural and intuitive way and they do not need to think too much to under,stand,the mean,""ings during the fast exploration.,""",,,,
"In addition to the wheel, they also agree that the significance curve is a very important feature, because without the overview, they will have no choice but to wildly explore the whole document str,""eam,"",which cou,""ld make them feel insecure.,""",,,,
"For example, during the free exploration, they were all interested in those time points when the curve is very steep, and spent some time there trying to figure out why.",,,,
"Therefore, they also feel that the accuracy of the curve is extremely important.",,,,
"Otherwise, the curve is misleading.",,,,
"In addition to those positive comments, they also raised a few constructive suggestions.",,,,
"For example, five users feel that using thickness to perform quantitative comparison is not very efficient.",,,,
"Therefore, they suggested we provide an option to show actual numbers when the thicknesses are too similar to compare.",,,,
Another suggestion is regarding the system control.,,,,
"For example, some of the users would like to control the sensitivity of the wheel to the summarized keyword sentiments, so they can ignore those minor fluctuations and focus more on big patterns.",,,,
Some of them would like to be able to add or remove keywords during exploration other than choosing them before exploring.,,,,
"We think these suggestions are all very valuable, and intended to explore them in future work.",,,,
"Furthermore, we also plan to deploy to a news Web site to reach more audiences and further improve our system based on their comments.",,,,
9,,,,
"DISCUSSIONS From the experiments, we can see that our system has advantages and can encode a lot of information into one display for analysis such that some unexpected correlations may emerge.",,,,
"Meanwhile, we also identify some weaknesses of our system.",,,,
Our system can handle thousands of documents and tens of keywords effectively.,,,,
"If the news \x0cstreams contain too many articles, exploration may still take a very long time and reduce its effectiveness.",,,,
Too many keywords may overwhelm the keyword wheels and cause clutter in the display.,,,,
"To deal with this problem, it is better to use our system together with some data mining techniques to first narrow down the document scope.",,,,
"Some well-established techniques in the visualization field, such as clutter reduction methods, can also be applied.",,,,
"As our system provides useful information into one display, it is possible that users are overwhelmed and lose their focus.",,,,
"Thus, we recommend that users turn off some features of the system and only focus on one feature at the beginning.",,,,
"After getting familiar with the data, more details can be brought into the display.",,,,
10,,,,
"CONCLUSION In this article, we have presented a visual analytics system for large-scale news streams.",,,,
"Our system aims at providing the multiple attributes of news articles and keywords, the dynamic relations between news articles and keywords, the micro relation among keywords, and the macro relatio,n amo,ng docume,""nts simultaneously to users for analysis.,""",,,,
"We designed an original TextWheel which consists of a document transportation belt, one or multiple keyword wheels, and a chain system to connect the belt and wheel.",,,,
Our system is based on some everyday objects which users are familiar with and thus the learning curve for our system should be low.,,,,
"We demonstrated the effectiveness of our system by applying it to several news corpora related to some major companies, obtaining some interesting findings.",,,,
The application of our system is not limited to news streams.,,,,
"It can be used to analyze other data in text format (e.g., emails, blogs, and internal memos), and to reveal the macro/micro relations existing in other data formats, such as video clips.",,,,
"In the future, we plan to further extend our system to encode more attributes of text documents.",,,,
We believe the integration of our system with other data mining methods will make it more powerful.,,,,
We also want to encode the uncertainty associated with the sentiment and co-occurrence computations.,,,,
"Although we conducted a user study which has suggested that our subjects agree that our design and system can help them with pattern huntings in macro/micro relations, it is still preliminary and in,forma,""l.,"",",,,,
"Therefore, we also plan to conduct a more thorough user study, which involves more subjects, comparison with other tools, and a formal questionnaire-based survey.",,,,
PeopleGarden: Creating Data Portraits for Users ABSTRACT Many on-line interaction environments have a large number of users.,,,,
"It is difficult for the participants, especially new ones, to form a clear mental image about those with whom they are interacting.",,,,
How can we compactly convey information about these participants to each other?,,,,
"We propose the data portrait, a novel graphical representation of users based on their past interactions.",,,,
Data portraits can inform users about each other and the overall social environment.,,,,
"We use a flower metaphor for creating individual data portraits, and a garden metaphor for combining these portraits to represent an on-line environment.",,,,
We will review previous work in visualizing both individuals and groups.,,,,
"We will then describe our visualizations, explain how to create them, and show how they can be used to address user questions.",,,,
"KEYWORDS: Information visualization, data portraits, user-centered visualization, interaction context.",,,,
1,,,,
"INTRODUCTION On-line interaction environments such as Web-based message boards, chat rooms, and Usenet newsgroups have become widely popular.",,,,
"As the number of participants rises, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish individual users and to comprehend the overall interaction context.",,,,
"Often, users must piece together a holistic view of other users through extended participation.",,,,
This makes it difficult for new users to find appropriate groups to participate in and people to interact with.,,,,
Even existing users may find it difficult to keep track of an ever-changing population.,,,,
Figure 1.,,,,
Users??questions about a discussion group.,,,,
A simple solution to seeing information about users is to sort all the postings by author.,,,,
Deja's Web interface for the Usenet news shows author's previous postings [Deja99].,,,,
"""While such views offer some information about authors level of involvement or interests, users still need to search for responses from other authors or for comparison with other authors of the grou,""p."""","",,",,,,
"""What is needed is the ability to look at different patterns in the archives of postings, such as users contribution, the rate of responses, the interaction among users, etc..""",,,,
"Although such patterns are hard to see in a mass of archival data, by visualizing the salient data, the key roles and relationships can be readily perceived.",,,,
Our solution is the data portraits (see Figure 2).,,,,
"Unlike photo-realistic portraits, which show physical features such as gender, age, or race; data portraits are abstract representations of users??interaction history.",,,,
What is missing is effective communication of information about participants to each other.,,,,
Figure 1 lists four questions users might ask about the underlying social environment (the quantitative measures in parentheses provide insights to these questions): Figure 2.,,,,
What can data portraits like the ones above tell us about discussion groups?,,,,
A group with a dominating voice vs. a more democratic group.,,,,
"In following sections, first we discuss previous peoplecentered visualizations in more detail.",,,,
"In Section 3, we will define data portraits and discuss how they can be created.",,,,
"Section 4 describes in detail PeopleFlower, our method for creating data portraits.",,,,
Section 5 describes how PeopleGarden uses a series of PeopleFlowers to represent the different users of an on-line environment.,,,,
Sections 6 and 7 shed light on the details of implementation and design rationale.,,,,
"Finally, Section 8 describes the future work and Section 9 concludes.",,,,
2,,,,
"PREVIOUS WORK IN VISUALIZING PEOPLE Information visualization has traditionally been used for the analysis of large amounts of commercial, financial, and scientific data.",,,,
"With the decreasing cost of graphics hardware, it has increasingly been used to help people to interactively filter through information for everyday tasks such as selecting movies [Ahlberg94, Card99,""].,"",,",,,,
"We examine here people-centered visualizations for showing data about a person, illuminating relationships among people, and for representing individuals for on-line interaction.",,,,
2.1 Visualizing individual's history There has been relatively little work focusing on visualizing information about individuals.,,,,
"One notable exception is Plaisant et al's LifeLines, which shows detailed life history of a person using time-lines [Plaisant96].",,,,
"""It is effective for detailed examination of an individuals medical or criminal records, but is not meant for comparing a group of people.""",,,,
"2.2 Visualizing relationships among people Comparisons of groups of people have been the focus of social network analysis, which studies the dynamics of relationships among people using a network di,agram,: each pe,""rson is represented as a node, links between nodes represent various connections between people.,""",,,,
"Originating with Jacob Moreno's sociometric research [Moreno36] in the 1920's, social network analysis has demonstrated the dense interconnections between people that allow any two people on Earth,to c,onnect th,""rough six or fewer intermediaries [Milgram67].,""",,,,
"Network diagrams have also been used to illuminate the empirical structure of local communities, inter-office patterns of communication, and collaboration patterns for papers [Wellman79, Krebs96, Ka,utz98,""].,"",",,,,
"When there are a large number of links, the network diagrams can get fairly complex.",,,,
"These visualizations are useful for sociologists to analyze group dynamics, but are less suitable for average users to gain a sense of the connections among people.",,,,
"""A related piece of work is Judith Donath's VisualWho[Donath95], which uses the positions and shades of peoples names to convey their affiliation and presence.""",,,,
"The emphasis of the visualization is more on showing relationships among people, and less on information about individuals.",,,,
2.3 Representing people A third area of related work is the design of avatars in virtual environments.,,,,
"Avatars include such varied representations as smiley faces, cartoon characters, 3D models, or photographic representation of users [Damer97, Kurlander96].",,,,
Avatars have been used in a variety of 2D and 3D chat rooms and virtual environments.,,,,
Steve Benford's avatars show where in the virtual environment a user is looking at and acting upon [Benford94].,,,,
Paul Rankin's Star Cursor uses the idea of inner vs. outer space to convey interests of users [Rankin98].,,,,
"Fernanda Viegas??Chat Circle represents users as circles, and changes the size of a circle if the user sends out a message [Viegas99].",,,,
"""These avatars show the current state of the individuals, but do not change over time based on users past interactions.""",,,,
"They do not convey how long the person represented has been in an environment, or whether he/she is a prolific contributor to the conversation.",,,,
3,,,,
"""THE DATA PORTRAIT While there are previous visualizations that convey a users history, show how users are related, or are compact enough to represent individuals in an on-line environment, we have,not f,ound a si,""ngle visualization that combines all of the above."""",""",,,,
"Our solution is the data portrait, or user visualization based on interaction data, both to represent individual users and to compare multiple users.",,,,
"""In real life, successful portraits show the physical likeliness of people; they also use objects in peoples lives to illustrate their interests and status [Art97, Brilliant93].""",,,,
This second aspect is an inspiration for our work.,,,,
"""The on-line equivalent of ones objects is data about ones past interactions.""",,,,
"""For a Web-based message board, where users can post messages or respond to others messages, a user's data objects are the set of all the messages posted by him/her.""",,,,
"In a chat room, the data objects are the messages sent by each user.",,,,
A data portrait is a visualization of the user based on his/her data objects.,,,,
Different portraits can be created for different users depending on the number and attributes of the data objects.,,,,
"Possible attributes for data objects such as messages include time of creation, size, addressee, whether an initial message or a response, or number of responses from others.",,,,
"Various visual parameters such as the size, hue, saturation, or shape of the data portrait can then be used to represent these attributes.",,,,
"The challenge in creating successful data portraits is thus two-fold: 1) selecting those attributes about data objects that best convey information about a user, and 2) deciding how to visualize the,se at,tributes,""legibly and intuitively.,""",,,,
"Over time, a user's portrait changes based on his changing interaction; the portrait will thus always show the most upto-date data about its user.",,,,
"Unlike avatar representation, these portraits are based on real interaction history.",,,,
A collection of data portraits can be used to represent the participants of an on-line environment.,,,,
"Such an overview allows users to see overall trends in the data, such as the level of user participation or the amount of interaction.",,,,
"Because data portraits are generated by simple, uniform rules, they form small multiples that can be compared and contrasted [Tufte91].",,,,
"As with any visualizations of user information, user privacy is a concern.",,,,
Our focus is on using information visualization within the context of a community.,,,,
The visualizations are of publicly available data about the people in the community and their relationships; the target audience is also the members of that community.,,,,
"visualizations of Usenet newsgroups, Web page traversals, or Chat room interactions with few modifications.",,,,
We will discuss more in Section 8.,,,,
"Each PeopleFlower represent a user of the message board, and its petals his/her postings.",,,,
The different visual parameters of a petal can be used to represent different attributes about each posting.,,,,
"We found the time of posting, the amount of response, and whether a post starts a new conversation to be the three most valuable attributes in conveying social information about the user, as demonst,rated,""below.,"",",,,,
4.1 Time since posting Time of posting is an important attribute for showing posting history.,,,,
PeopleFlower indicates time in both the ordering and the saturation of petals.,,,,
A message posted far in the past would be less saturated and less noticeable.,,,,
"As a user posts more messages to the board, his or her PeopleFlower will change, as shown in Figure 4.",,,,
4,,,,
"PEOPLE FLOWER: VISUALIZING A USER We will now discuss in more detail PeopleFlower, our visualization of the individual.",,,,
"Each user is represented as a flower, as shown in Figure 3.",,,,
"His/her data objects are represented as petals of the flower, arranged by time in a clockwise fashion.",,,,
Figure 4.,,,,
A user's PeopleFlower changes over time.,,,,
"A few things to note here: ??The numbers of petals increases as more messages are posted, just as a flower opens up.",,,,
"??Older petals move to the left as newer petals are added to the right, to maintain symmetry.",,,,
The overall shape of a flower is determined by how many petals it has.,,,,
??Each petal fades over time showing time since posting.,,,,
"??A marked difference in saturation of adjacent petals, seen in the rightmost flower, denotes a gap in posting.",,,,
Figure 3.,,,,
Basic PeopleFlower.,,,,
Visual artists have long emphasized using representations that have the same level of visual and conceptual complexity as the objects they represent [Arnheim89].,,,,
We therefore wanted a simple object that can easily deal with a changing number of components.,,,,
"We also like the organic nature of a flower, and the suggestion that it changes over time, as users do.",,,,
The flower metaphor was chosen for its simplicity and intuitiveness.,,,,
"Other visualizations that use radial layout to display data include radar sweep visualizations and Kiviat Diagrams [Jefferies97, Harris97].",,,,
"For more technical discussions on creating organic or nonphoto-realistic rendering, see [Kowalski99, Raskar99] 4.2 Response to posting For simplicity, we will focus our discussion on a Webbased mess,age b,""oard.,"",",,,,
Our findings can be generalized to Figure 5.,,,,
"Three users with same amount of postings over different durations, and with different amount of responses.",,,,
"PeopleFlower can display not only a user's own posting pattern, but also the amount of feedback from other users of the board.",,,,
This is important for illustrating the amount of interaction in an environment.,,,,
We have used pistil-like circles on top of the petals to denote responses.,,,,
"Each circle indicates one response to a post, as shown in Figure 5.",,,,
"While the three users in Figure 5 posted the same amount of messages, they posted at different time interval, as indicated by the saturation of the petals.",,,,
The amount of responses also varies greatly.,,,,
"??User A posted a series of messages in a short interval, and has not posted for a while.",,,,
"??Initial response to A was high, over time it decreased.",,,,
"??Users B and C both posted their messages over longer intervals, but C has gotten much more response.",,,,
4.3 Initial post vs. reply Why do the amounts of responses differ for these three users?,,,,
Figure 6 shows the same PeopleFlowers with petals colored by whether the post starts a new conversation (i.e.,,,,
initial posts versus replies).,,,,
This scheme has been used in the Loom visualization for newsgroups [Donath99].,,,,
Figure 6.,,,,
"The same three users from Figure 5, this time with magenta representing initial posts, blue replies.",,,,
(See http://graphics.lcs.mit.edu/~becca/papers/pgarden .),,,,
Figure 7.,,,,
Traditional view of a message board.,,,,
PeopleGarden specifies how to layout the flowers for overview and comparison of users.,,,,
We have used the garden metaphor because a healthy garden has certain properties that we can use to represent a healthy discussion group.,,,,
"For example, a garden with more bright flowers indicates a discussion group with more new posts.",,,,
It looks healthier than one with faded flowers representing a group with mostly old posts.,,,,
Figure 8 shows a PeopleGarden created for the same message board.,,,,
"The height of a flower represents how long a user has been in the board, as indicated by time of first posting.",,,,
This uses the metaphor that a flower planted earlier is taller than one planted later.,,,,
"A few patterns here: ??Many people have participated at the board since the beginning, and have been prolific contributors since.",,,,
"User A started with an initial post (shown in magenta), perhaps a question or a new topic of discussion.",,,,
There were many responses.,,,,
"Then User A replied to others??postings, and the level of response gradually dropped.",,,,
??A large number of casual participants dropped by to make a few posts.,,,,
??There are more users joining the board in the first half than the second.,,,,
"""??User B only responded to others posts, as indicated by all blue posts.""",,,,
??Users C made both initial posts and replies.,,,,
This user likes to both start new conversation and interact with others.,,,,
User C received the most replies.,,,,
We can also notice outliers such as the big red flower twothirds from the top and two-thirds from the left of Figure 8.,,,,
"While most people have more to say the longer they have been at the board, this relative late-comer has really bloomed and contributed much to the discussion.",,,,
We gain more insight into the situation: ??This example seems to suggest that one way to get more response from others would be to start a new conversation.,,,,
"See [Whittaker98, Smith99] for more studies about the interaction dynamics of Usenet newsgroups.",,,,
Now let us return to the four user questions we have raised at the beginning of the paper about on-line environments: Q1.,,,,
Do participants here really get involved?,,,,
(Post frequently or only once in a while?),,,,
Q2.,,,,
How much interaction is there?,,,,
(Do people reply?),,,,
5,,,,
"PEOPLE GARDEN: VISUALIZING GROUP OF USERS Having described our representation of individual users, we will now turn to placing these individual representations in the larger context of the on-going,discu,""ssions, i"","".e.,""",,,,
the message board.,,,,
Figure 7 shows a section of a sample board with about 1200 messages posted by 150 authors over the period of two months.,,,,
"Currently, users need to read through a large amount of text to determine who's who in the message board.",,,,
PeopleGarden is designed to facilitate this task.,,,,
"While PeopleFlower specifies how to represent individual users, Q3.",,,,
Do participants here welcome newcomers?,,,,
(Do newcomers get many replies?),,,,
Q4.,,,,
Who are the experts?,,,,
(Who has been here for some time or posted many messages?),,,,
The PeopleGarden in Figure 8 can help to answer a couple of these questions.,,,,
A1.,,,,
There are many users here with varying level of involvement.,,,,
"Many of them have also posted continuously, denoted by smooth change of saturation across a wide range.",,,,
Figure 8.,,,,
A PeopleGarden showing messages from a message board with 1200 postings over a 2-month period.,,,,
Height of flower denotes amount of time a user has been at the board.,,,,
A4.,,,,
"The most prolific contributors also tend to be those who have been here the longest, and can be found at the top of the figure.",,,,
"Figure 8 is useful for answering questions about general posting trends, since all the flowers are displayed at once.",,,,
"For detailed questions about the level of responses to individuals, another view is required.",,,,
Figure 9 shows a different PeopleGarden that lays out flowers sorted by the amount of petals.,,,,
Posts are colored differently based on whether it is an initial post.,,,,
The responses for each post are also shown.,,,,
A smaller message board is used here to show the details more closely.,,,,
Figure 9 can help to answer the remaining questions: A2.,,,,
People in this board respond to each other quite a bit.,,,,
"In fact, most posts are responses shown in blue, and more than half the posts are replied to, as indicated by the gold pistils.",,,,
A3.,,,,
"Newcomers shown at the bottom have a 50-50 chance of getting a response, only slightly worse than the oldtimers.",,,,
"Also, their initial posts are much more likely to get a response.",,,,
Figure 9.,,,,
A PeopleGarden sorted by amount of postings.,,,,
"Magenta denotes initial postings, and blue replies.",,,,
(See http://graphics.lcs.mit.edu/~becca/papers/pgarden for colored picture.),,,,
5.1 Comparing different groups PeopleGarden applied to multiple groups shows how the interaction in these groups differs.,,,,
"For example, Figure 10 shows the PeopleGardens for two groups with around 200 posts each, but very different interaction.",,,,
Height of a flower again denotes how long a user has been at the board.,,,,
The URLs for the two groups are respectively Figure 10a) shows a group with one dominating voice with many initial posts (in magenta) and more responses (in blue).,,,,
"There is a trickle of new participants throughout the time period, most of whom tend to post replies.",,,,
This is more a discussion group with predominantly replies in blue.,,,,
Figure 10b) shows a more democratic group with more equal participation.,,,,
"There are a larger number of participants, each of who posted between 1 and 10 messages.",,,,
People tend to post more initial posts than replies.,,,,
This suggests that this group is more of an announcement group.,,,,
6,,,,
IMPLEMENTATION PeopleGarden has been implemented as a Java applet.,,,,
Each petal of a PeopleFlower is a 4-sided polygon.,,,,
"To create a flower, draw each petal in a clockwise fashion.",,,,
The spacing between petals is the same for all flowers in a garden.,,,,
The flower with the largest number of petals almost completes a circle.,,,,
PeopleGarden lays out the individual flowers by setting their center point.,,,,
"For example, the sorted view reduces row by row the spacing between the center points of flowers.",,,,
"Thus, the later flowers with less information will not take up disproportional amount of screen real estate.",,,,
7,,,,
DISCUSSION Different encodings of the display and layout of PeopleFlowers can be used for expressing different data.,,,,
How does one decide which visual encoding to use?,,,,
"While we have not yet conducted formal user testing, we have collected informal feedback from people.",,,,
We found that people prefer encodings with some basis in reality.,,,,
"For example, most users found it easy to tell how long a user has participated in the message board based on the height of the flower.",,,,
"For encodings not based on physical reality, simpler is usually better.",,,,
"For example, the two-tone coloring of petals is fairly easy to comprehend.",,,,
"But when more than two colors are used, the display becomes too cluttered.",,,,
"Also, we have experimented with showing time of posting based on angular position of petals, but this produced irregular flowers that were too complex to compare at a glance.",,,,
"Figure 10 a) A group with one dominating voice (http://graphics.lcs.mit.edu/~becca/enneagram/movieboard, July ??9) with a large number of replies in blue.",,,,
Height of a flower denotes how long a user has been at the board.,,,,
How does PeopleFlower scale as the number of posts for a given user increases?,,,,
We found that the petals can still be distinguished clearly when the ends of adjacent petals are more than one pixel apart.,,,,
"However, pistils representing responses cannot overlap, or the result would be illegible.",,,,
One solution would be to use each petal to represent the average or median value of multiple data objects.,,,,
"Since our visualization is based on users??actual history, we need to be concerned with their privacy.",,,,
The visualizations presented here use only publicly available posting histories.,,,,
"For more sensitive information, a possible solution is to not specify user identity, or use only pseudonyms.",,,,
Our visualization can still show patterns about an interaction environment without identifying individuals.,,,,
8,,,,
APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE WORK PeopleGarden can be readily applied to other threaded discussion space such as Usenet newsgroups.,,,,
It can also be applied to other interaction spaces such as chat rooms with some modifications.,,,,
One small difference is that there are no clear distinction between initial post and response.,,,,
We can use instead different categorizations of chat messages such as question versus a statement.,,,,
A related application is representing users??traversal history through a Web site.,,,,
There are several directions of future work for PeopleGarden.,,,,
We would like to conduct formal user testing for more detailed answers about which encoding works best for people and further evolve our designs.,,,,
"We would like to dynamically update PeopleFlowers of users in Web boards, and chat rooms.",,,,
One can watch the growth of a PeopleGarden over time as users interact more with each other.,,,,
9,,,,
"CONCLUSION To interact effectively on-line, one needs to know about other participants.",,,,
"Unfortunately, existing interaction environments require extensive participation for users to form a holistic view of the interaction context.",,,,
We believe that these environments can be enhanced by re-introducing the social context present in physical interactions.,,,,
We have presented the data portrait as a novel method for conveying information about participants of an on-line environment.,,,,
PeopleFlower visualizes a user's posting history: PeopleGarden uses a collection of these flowers to represent users of a message board.,,,,
The various views of PeopleGarden can be used to successfully answer user questions about the board.,,,,
PeopleGarden can be extended to other on-line environments to illustrate their social context.,,,,
"We believe that these data portraits can help users to understand an interaction space, see how it changes over time, and provide a mirror for the level and nature of the interaction in that space.,"","",,",,,,
"DancingWords: exploring animated word clouds to tell stories Abstract By encoding semantic relations into relative positions, word clouds have shown the capability to deliver richer messages than pure,ly vi,sualizing,""word frequencies.,""",,,,
"Existing studies mainly focus on layout algorithms that cluster related words, preserve temporal coherence, and optimize spatial shapes.",,,,
"However, they cannot fully convey multiple relations among words and their evolvement through relative positions and static representations.",,,,
"In this paper, we explore animated word clouds that take advantage of storytelling strategies to present interactions between words and show the dynamic process of content changes, thus communicatin,g the,underlyi,""ng stories.,""",,,,
We initially create several exemplars of animated word clouds with designers through a structured iterative design process.,,,,
These exemplars lead to a preliminary design space that distills essential narrative elements with design choices.,,,,
"Based on the design space, we develop a prototype tool, DancingWords, which provides story-oriented interactions and automatic layouts for users to generate animated word clouds.",,,,
We evaluate the expressiveness and usefulness of our system through several example animated stories and a usability study with general users.,,,,
The results show that DancingWords allows users to produce appealing storytelling videos easily and quickly for communication.,,,,
1 Introduction Word clouds have gained popularity for providing fast impressions of text data with prominent words (Felix et al. 2018).,,,,
They usually encode the word significance by font size and spatially arrange words on the canvas.,,,,
"Previous research on word clouds focuses on layout generations with various objectives, such as addressing the aesthetic issues (Vie?gas and Wattenberg 2008; Wang et al. 2020; Wor 2020) and communic,ating,relation,""ships between words (Cui et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2011; Hearst et al. 2019).,""",,,,
Recent studies \x0cutilize word clouds to facilitate storytelling.,,,,
"For example, researchers (Cui et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2011) encoded semantic relationships by relative positions.",,,,
"Wang et al. (2018a) introduced context-aware editing, which enables users to order words in a semantically meaningful way.",,,,
"However, current semantic word clouds are not effective in communicating stories at two key aspects.",,,,
The first aspect is to illustrate complex relationships between words at the same time.,,,,
A simple story like Little Red Riding Hood can have multiple roles and events between them.,,,,
"However, current encoding methods (e.g., sizes, relative positions, and colors) face challenges to express these relations clearly.",,,,
"For example, we can place words Wolf and Grandmother close to each other to show their co-occurrence in an event, but it is hard to reflect the status that Grandmother is in the stomach of Wolf.",,,,
"Besides, words in a word cloud provide different levels of information for the stories.",,,,
"For instance, Old describes Grandmother, while Forest indicates the location of the story.",,,,
"Second, narrative contents evolve ceaselessly with a set of events are advancing the story temporally and causally.",,,,
"For instance, the story initially occurs between Little Girl and Wolf; then, Wolf goes for Grandmother.",,,,
"Thus, a single word cloud for the whole story loses temporal information.",,,,
"Although consecutive changes can be visualized by word clouds side-by-side, it adds the cognitive load on viewers to track keywords, letting alone a story which might have multiple events simultaneo,usly.,"","",",,,,
"Therefore, intuitively revealing word relations and event changes remain an understudied problem.",,,,
"The first limitation requires an understanding of essential narrative elements and their relationships, which spurs us to propose new visual designs for enriching the expressiveness of traditional w,ord c,""louds.,"",",,,,
The designs should allow audiences to quickly perceive different narrative relations and keep consistent during the whole story.,,,,
"The second deficiency in conveying temporal evolution inspires us to leverage the merits of animation to improve the transition (Heer and Robertson 2007) and engage viewers (Tversky et al. 2002; Ami,ni et,al. 2018,"").,""",,,,
Combining animation with word clouds allows to unfold complex relationships in a story via the dimension of time.,,,,
"In this paper, we explore how animated word clouds can serve as a storytelling device.",,,,
"To understand the potential and identify designs, we follow a structured design process to create examples of animated word clouds for specific stories.",,,,
We collect a set of storytelling videos after several rounds of iterative design.,,,,
Further analysis and follow-up interviews with designers result in a preliminary design space to create animated word clouds.,,,,
"Based on the design space, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype, DancingWords, to assist the creation of animated word clouds for presentations.",,,,
"DancingWords encapsulates designs for essential narrative elements, provides automatic layouts, and offers visual embellishments to augment the expressiveness of word clouds.",,,,
Users can interactively specify relations between words and generate animation automatically.,,,,
We demonstrate the effectiveness with several examples and further evaluate the system with a usability study and received encouraging feedback.,,,,
"Our contributions are: ??We present a preliminary design space of animated word clouds for telling the underlying stories through an exploratory study, where we identify key narrative elements, prop,ose a,set of d,""esign factors, and summarize design goals.,""",,,,
"??Based on the design space, we develop DancingWords, an authoring tool that allows users to explore narratives and generate animation with automatic layouts interactively.",,,,
"2 Related work We reviewed previous work in two closely related topics, namely, word cloud visualization and storytelling visualization.",,,,
2.1 Word cloud-related visualization Word clouds are widespread because of their appealing visual design and capability to provide fast impressions of text data.,,,,
A word cloud automatically extracts frequent words from a text corpus and encodes the frequency by font size.,,,,
The spatial arrangement of words in word clouds has received much attention.,,,,
Plenty of layout algorithms have emerged with different design goals.,,,,
"Wordle (Vie?gas et al. 2009) arrange words in different colors and orientations for aesthetic criteria, which is widely used for text analysis (Li et al. 2018; Onoue et al. 2016).",,,,
One stream of word cloud-related studies (Wang et al. 2020; Wor 2020) aims to present the whole word cloud as a specific shape to attract viewers.,,,,
"Furthermore, morphable word \x0cclouds (Chi et al. 2015) constrain multiple word clouds in a set of evolving shapes and design smooth shape transitions with animation.",,,,
The animation layout follows the constrains of temporal coherence and compactness.,,,,
"In our layout algorithm, we currently do not consider the compactness of word clouds, but leave the space for word animation.",,,,
Another stream arranges words based on the relationships between each two words.,,,,
"For example, Wu et al. (2011) extracted semantically similar keywords from documents and positioned them close to each other.",,,,
"Cui et al. (2010) placed words which preserved similar context in the neighborhood, while preserving the temporal coherence among multiple word clouds.",,,,
"In addition, Wang et al. (2018a) provided a method that allows users to consistently edit word clouds and generate semantically meaningful layouts manually.",,,,
"Other works provide variants of word clouds to show context information, e.g., adding links between words to indicate co-occurrence (Wattenberg and Vigas 2008; Hu et al. 2017).",,,,
"Our work can be placed in this category, where we incorporate the narrative relations between words into word clouds.",,,,
"However, these existing methods cannot fully satisfy our requirements, since the word relations in stories are more than cooccurrence and evolve along the story advancement.",,,,
"Animation naturally unfolds the complex relations via the time dimension, which allows to present the story frame-by-frame.",,,,
"Besides, animation is regarded as one of mainstream storytelling mediums (Segel and Heer 2010), thus inspiring us to further explore how to combine animation and word clouds to tell stories.",,,,
"2.2 Storytelling visualization and authoring tools Data-driven storytelling (Segel and Heer 2010; Latif and Beck 2019) has attracted much attention in the public, which in turn spurs the need for au,thori,ng tools,""(Mei et al. 2018b).,""",,,,
"A palette of tools has emerged recently for different storytelling forms (e.g., Kim et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018b; Amini et al. 2017; Mei et al. 2018a; Lu et al. 2020), of which several are designe,d to,communica,""te insights for specific data or visualization types.,""",,,,
"For example, DataToon (Kim et al. 2019) focuses on creating data comics for dynamic graphs, and Timeline Storyteller (Brehmer et al. 2017) is devoted to timeline construction.",,,,
Our work is specific to word clouds and contributes an authoring tool that interactively crafts word clouds and animations to generate storytelling videos.,,,,
Video authoring tools such as Adobe After Effects allow designers to create animation freely.,,,,
"However, the flexibility sets barriers to novices, which requires users??creativity for animated design and familiarity with tools.",,,,
Data videos present different characteristics related to narrative constructs (Cao et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2020).,,,,
Bulterman and Hardman (2005) argued that a structure-based paradigm is useful for authoring video-based stories.,,,,
"Authoring tools build up a storyboard structure based on abstract narrative components, and users directly manipulate these components to complete the story.",,,,
"DancingWords follows a similar design paradigm, where we summarize essential story elements with designs and encapsulate corresponding animated designs in story-oriented interactions.",,,,
Users are able to create animated videos by interactively specifying relationships of words in a narrative order.,,,,
"3 Designing animated word clouds This section first introduces our study procedure during which we identified key narrative elements and collected example videos through several rounds of iterations,with,designer,""s.,""",,,,
"Based on the study, we summarized a preliminary design space.",,,,
"3.1 Study procedure This study went through five steps to explore essential narrative elements and designs in animated word clouds for storytelling, following a similar paradigm to create graph comi,cs (B,ach et al,"". 2016).,""",,,,
3.1.1 Understand storytelling We intended to take advantage of storytelling that helps to communicate underlying relations in word clouds.,,,,
It required us to identify essential narrative elements when telling a story.,,,,
"We first referred to the literature in the narratology (Bal 2009; Coulter and Smith 2009) and storytelling (Blazer 2016) and analyzed examples in different forms such as fictions, comics, and animat,ion.,"","",",,,,
"Since a multitude of studies has formed \x0ca large design space, we considered basic story components which contain a series of temporally and causally related events, and characters interacting in,a gi,ven setti,""ng (Bal 2009).,""",,,,
"Three fundamental dimensions are included in this definition, i.e., contexts, roles, and events.",,,,
"Contexts provide the background information of a story, e.g., indicating where and when the story occurs, introducing a narrative world to the audience.",,,,
Roles include characters and objects.,,,,
"Characters are actors of the story, and objects can act and interact with characters.",,,,
Events involve various activities between roles and are arranged in a specific order to advance the story.,,,,
Audience can naturally identify these narrative elements and understand the story.,,,,
Animated word clouds aim to leverage storytelling to improve communication.,,,,
3.1.2 Design prototypes with discussion Our second step was to explore possible designs that explicitly showed these narrative dimensions in animated word clouds.,,,,
We held a three-hour brainstorming seminar with six PhD students who have experience in storytelling visualization.,,,,
"During the brainstorming, we asked them to independently design visual representations for each narrative dimension and then discussed in a collaborative session.",,,,
The results converged to the following practices: ??Contexts are designed as underpaintings and introduced first.,,,,
??Roles are underlying topics composed by multiple adjacent words.,,,,
"Separated clusters of words indicate different roles, and their positions suggest their relations.",,,,
??Events represent the evolvement of topics and are displayed through animation.,,,,
"Two of our authors then produced four prototypes based on four documents of different length, i.e., Little Red Riding Hood, The Moon and Six Pence, part of Napoleon, and news summary.",,,,
"To collect external feedback and evaluate the video quality, we presented our prototypes to two experts, namely, a senior visualization researcher and an expert in computing aesthetics, and discusse,d in,the labor,""atory seminar.,""",,,,
They all provided feedback on the perception of content and aesthetics of animation design.,,,,
We further improved our videos after several iterations in this step.,,,,
"3.1.3 Design principles Based on our practices, we summarized three design principles to ensure readability.",,,,
These principles referred to previous studies (Tversky et al. 2002; Heer and Robertson 2007; Amini et al. 2018) in visualization and literature on animated storytelling (Blazer 2016).,,,,
??Positions should indicate semantics.,,,,
"For example, closely related words are clustered to represent a role, and different roles in the same context should be identified easily.",,,,
??Each animation should convey a certain narrative element and avoid meaningless movements.,,,,
"For example, if a word moves from one position to another, there must be a corresponding change on the relations of words.",,,,
"??Extra visual elements can be added to augment the expression, e.g., using background color or contours to show groups.",,,,
"3.1.4 Create animated word clouds with designers To validate the narrative dimensions and collect more design choices, we recruited seven video designers (five females, two males, aged between 21 an,d 25),from a u,""niversity by disseminating advertisements through emails and among online designer groups.,""",,,,
"All participants (p1?뱎7) have design-related major backgrounds, including Industrial Design (3), Information Visualization (2), Product Design (1), and Digital Media (1).",,,,
"They have received formal training in visual communication and had professional experience in making animated storytelling videos for academic or social purposes (mean = 2.86 years, range = 2?? year,""s).,"",,",,,,
"In addition, they all have experience in creating word clouds, and five of them are familiar with information visualization.",,,,
"Each participant was paid ranging from $30 to $40 according to the video quality with diverse designs, which were judged by the first three paper authors.",,,,
The whole procedure is as follows.,,,,
"We first gave a brief introduction to our theme, i.e., animating word clouds that enables to communicate the underlying stories.",,,,
"Next, we showed participants our current videos and other animated storytelling forms, since appropriate example videos are useful to guide the design \x0cprocess (Kerzner et al. 2019).",,,,
We also emphasized that visual representations are not limited to the given examples and encouraged novel designs for different narrative dimensions during the whole process.,,,,
"After the introduction, we required participants to generate animated word clouds for the story, Little Red Riding Hood.",,,,
We chose this story to collect designs due to two major reasons.,,,,
"First, this story covered basic elements identified in the first step and are familiar to participants.",,,,
"Second, they did not need to spend time collecting extra information and reading large text documents.",,,,
"Before instantiating the videos, we asked participants to sketch their ideas first.",,,,
"We closely communicated with them during the process, ensuring that the final video should clearly convey the story and their designs conform to word cloud visualization.",,,,
"Sketches involved storyboarding, basic layouts at key frames, and animation designs.",,,,
"After that, participants produced videos using different tools.",,,,
"Four of them chose Adobe After Effect, and the others used Microsoft PowerPoint.",,,,
"After watching the first version of videos, five participants were asked to fine-tune parts of their videos which were hard to follow or interpret.",,,,
It took \x18 5 hours (except the tuning time) on average for a video.,,,,
"3.1.5 Post interview After the study, we interviewed the participants about the authoring process and design choices, i.e., what narrative elements help communication, and how these elements were vi,suall,y present,""ed.,""",,,,
"First, they agreed that the three basic dimensions (i.e., contexts, roles, and events) were critical to convey stories.",,,,
"In fact, these narrative dimensions guided their design process.",,,,
"They first roughly segmented the story according to the context information, then refined the narrative structure based on the evolvement of roles, and finally determined the storyboarding in line w,ith e,""vents.,"",",,,,
"Second, designers reported on several rationales they adopted during the process based on their previous experience.",,,,
They suggested explicit and consistent designs for each narrative element can help identify the specific element and communicate the relations.,,,,
"In addition, they preferred to enhance the performance of animated storytelling with additional visual embellishments.",,,,
"For example, they added roles??pictures and figurative icons to enrich expression.",,,,
"Therefore, we proposed another dimension for such effects.",,,,
"Through the interviews, we decomposed videos with the designers and grouped design choices in narrative elements.",,,,
We converged towards a design space of animated word clouds for storytelling by iterative discussions.,,,,
"3.2 Design space Based on related literature on narratology (Bal 2009; Coulter and Smith 2009) and interviews with designers, we first built the design space with four dimension (i.e., contexts, rol,""es, e"",""vents, an"",""d embellishments).,""",,,,
"To codify the videos, two authors decomposed the video with designers and corresponded the designs to each narrative dimension during the postinterviews.",,,,
"Thus, we collected multiple pairs of design and its narrative dimension.",,,,
"Moreover, considering the visual differences of designs in each dimension, we re-examined their narrative roles in the animated stories and further distinguished narrative elements after iterative d,iscus,sions amo,""ng authors.,""",,,,
We present design strategies for each narrative elements (E1?밇8) as follows.,,,,
It is noted that we do not intend to exhaust the methods and give an inclusive design space.,,,,
Figures demonstrate descriptive examples derived from our collected videos.,,,,
"3.2.1 Dimension I: Display of contexts Contexts, also referred to settings, set up the main background and atmosphere of the story.",,,,
According to our interview in Sect.,,,,
"3.1.5, participants declared that when they were designing the story, they first illustrated contexts, such as where and when the stories took place.",,,,
"It is common that a story consists of multiple contexts, which requires designs to set up a single context and show a switch process of contexts.",,,,
E1.,,,,
"Context setup Context information encircles a set of words in a scope using contours, background colors, and screen split (Fig.",,,,
1a).,,,,
Words that specify the context information are better to be explicitly displayed around the scope.,,,,
These designs conform to the law of common region in Gestalt principles (Palmer 1992).,,,,
Viewers can naturally perceive that the story takes place in this certain context.,,,,
E2.,,,,
Scene switch These designs (Fig.,,,,
1b) refer to similar techniques in cinematography (Mascelli 2005).,,,,
"Both camera motions and pushing effects trace the changing path of different contexts, while zoom shows that the story develops into the previous context.",,,,
"3.2.2 Dimension II: Cast of roles Roles could be a significant impetus in storytelling, which unfold the story based on their own growth or relation changes with others.",,,,
The interview with designers indicated that the evolvement of roles helped determine key frames.,,,,
"In word clouds, we planned to reveal the changes of topics through specifying words as ?섃쁱oles.?쇺?Specifically, we described two possible relations of roles, i.e., groups of multiple roles (E3),and,attached,""information to a role (E4).,""",,,,
E3.,,,,
"Groups Groups are organized by roles on the same side, and different groups are identified by semantic relations.",,,,
It can be displayed via contours and background colors according to the common region (Palmer 1992) or shown as network visualization (Fig.,,,,
2a).,,,,
E4.,,,,
"Description Description represents words that are closely related to the core topic, but cannot illustrate topics by themselves as attached information.",,,,
They are placed around the related roles according to the proximity law (Max 1923).,,,,
Visual metaphors like dashed links and brackets are also used for description.,,,,
3.2.3 Dimension III: Event representation An event in the story indicates that some changes take place (Bal 2009).,,,,
A series of events are arranged casually and temporally to describe the dynamic process.,,,,
Words in the event dimension are used to explain the relations between roles.,,,,
"Traditional stories can contain a variety of events for expressiveness, but we do not consider to design for each event type.",,,,
"In this paper, we present two typical events according to different design strategies, i.e., action and dialog.",,,,
E5.,,,,
Action We found that designers leverage graphics to manifest events.,,,,
"For example, an arrow with words from one role to another explains a directed event (Fig.",,,,
"3a-1), and dashed lines weaken the directionality between two roles (Fig.",,,,
3a-2).,,,,
Figure 3a-3 shows another common action which objects are exchanged between two roles.,,,,
E6.,,,,
Dialog Dialog events are commonly designed differently in comparison with the action event.,,,,
"Typically they use visual metaphors, e.g., speakers, dialog, and thought bubbles (Fig.",,,,
3b).,,,,
"3.2.4 Dimension IV: Visual embellishments In addition to the three essential narrative elements, designers have put great efforts in designing good storytelling effects.",,,,
The postinterview in Sect.,,,,
3.1.5 reflected on their strong intentions to increase story retention and convey emotions with visual embellishments.,,,,
"Therefore, we propose another dimension to the animated word clouds for storytelling.",,,,
There should be a variety of methods to embellish animation in fact.,,,,
We describe two strategies our participants commonly used in their designs.,,,,
E7.,,,,
"Icons The benefit of integrating pictographs or icons to augment the expression has been widely discussed in communicative visualization (Amini et al. 2015; Bateman et al. 2010), such as lowering in,terpr,etation t,""ime and impressing viewers.,""",,,,
"Compared to plain texts, icons play vital roles in engagement.",,,,
E8.,,,,
Special effects Designers include special animation designs to convey certain emotions.,,,,
"For example, a word ?섃쁞umps?쇺?another that depicts a fierce fight.",,,,
Some words circled by thought bubbles represent dialogs.,,,,
These kinds of designs mimic traditional 2D animation.,,,,
"Most of them are designed based on well-established guidelines, such as Disney's twelve principles of animation (Thomas and Johnston 1995).",,,,
"4 DancingWords This section presents design goals we proposed for our authoring tool, DancingWords, followed by the design details of each part.",,,,
4.1 Design goals We settled on three design goals based on the preliminary design space and observations of the authoring processes.,,,,
??G1.,,,,
Set up narrative elements interactively The system should allow users to directly assign words with narrative elements based on their relations and provide corresponding designs.,,,,
Encapsulated interactions can facilitate the story-oriented authoring process (Bulterman and Hardman 2005).,,,,
Fig.,,,,
3 Designs for events.,,,,
a Event and b dialog.,,,,
The black arrows indicate the animation process.,,,,
The opacity distinguishes different states during the animation \x0cFig.,,,,
4 DancingWords consists of five components.,,,,
a A top menu bar provides basic file operations and shows the title.,,,,
b The left data panel lists words in different chapters and allows users to add and check words.,,,,
c The content canvas supports content authoring and reviewing with a set of story-oriented interactions (d).,,,,
e The timeline panel presents a timeline with thumbnails of key frames ??G2.,,,,
Support the story-driven auto-layout The system should organize the layout of word clouds according to different narrative elements and designs.,,,,
It alleviates the efforts of manual adjustment and achieves congruence during animation.,,,,
??G3.,,,,
Incorporate visual embellishments Visual embellishments can greatly increase the retention and engaging effects of animated storytelling as mentioned in Dimension IV.,,,,
The system should allow to improve animated word clouds with E7 and E8.,,,,
"4.2 System design Following the design space and goals, we developed a prototype web-based system, DancingWords, to assist the creation.",,,,
4.2.1 Usage scenario DancingWords works as a proof-of-concept tool to create animated word clouds for storytelling.,,,,
"Target users can be both designers who use the tool for rapid video prototyping and iteration, and novices who can easily author animated stories for presentation.",,,,
"We present a usage scenario to demonstrate how a hypothetical author can use DancingWords to quickly create an animated story, Little Red Riding Hood.",,,,
The user begins the creation by importing the original text document to the tool.,,,,
DancingWords automatically extracts a set of frequent words and lists them in the decreasing order of frequency (Fig.,,,,
"4b), which is similar to generate typical word clouds.",,,,
The system allows users to add or modify some words and their frequencies if needed.,,,,
The user then creates the animated stories by crafting key frames.,,,,
Take a plot as an example where grandmother gives a hat to her little girl .,,,,
"The user first chooses the words Girl, Grandma, and Hat from the data panel (Fig.",,,,
4b).,,,,
"Considering the little Girl is the leading role of the story, the user wants to enrich the expression and uses pictographs.",,,,
"By clicking on the word Girl, the user uploads an icon Give interaction from the set of interactions to replace the plain text (Fig.",,,,
4c-1) and then chooses the (Fig.,,,,
4d) to complete this plot.,,,,
After specifying the mode (Fig.,,,,
"4c-2), the user clicks on two roles, Grandma and the icon, successively.",,,,
The system automatically generates an arrow between the specified roles.,,,,
The user then drags the word Hat to the arrow and finishes the event.,,,,
The output animation is expected to move the word Hat from the word Grandma to the girl icon following a parabola path.,,,,
The system also provides alternative designs (Fig.,,,,
4c-3) for users based on the preliminary design study.,,,,
The current key frame on the \x0ctimeline will be updated with the newly added interaction icon and content thumbnail (Fig.,,,,
4e-1).,,,,
"Moreover, users can click the refresh button (Fig.",,,,
4e-3) to re-layout this frame if unsatisfied with the current automatic layout.,,,,
"After finishing the content of this frame, the user adds a new key frame (Fig.",,,,
4e-2).,,,,
The words for the ?섃쁟ontext?쇺?and ?섃쁱ole?쇺?dimensions will be checked and appear in the follow-up frame by default.,,,,
"The user then repeats operations, choosing words in the data panel, acting with different interactions according to the story content, and generating the animation.",,,,
He could re-play the animation during the creation process to check the effects and refine the content.,,,,
"Finally, satisfied with the results, the user exports the video for presentations (Fig.",,,,
7).,,,,
4.2.2 User interface The user interface is implemented using Vue.js.,,,,
"The main view uses Konva, an HTML Canvas Javascript library, to interactively manipulate 2D context.",,,,
"Figure 4 shows our authoring tool that allows general users to create animated word clouds in an integrated process from importing data, interacting with narrative elements, to exporting videos.",,,,
The interface is composed of five UI components.,,,,
The top menu bar (Fig.,,,,
"4a) provides basic file operations (i.e., new, save, load, and export).",,,,
The left data panel (Fig.,,,,
4b) lists all imported words in a decreasing order of frequency.,,,,
Checked words are displayed in the content canvas (Fig.,,,,
"4c), which supports content authoring and reviewing.",,,,
A set of story-oriented interactions are arranged vertically on the right (Fig.,,,,
4d).,,,,
These interactions are grouped according to the three different narrative dimensions.,,,,
The bottom of the interface (Fig.,,,,
"4e) presents a timeline with thumbnails of key frames, where users can review and re-edit the key frames they have created.",,,,
"For example, dragging the interaction icon out of the thumbnail (Fig.",,,,
4e-1) could delete this interaction.,,,,
"4.2.3 Story-oriented Interactions To incorporate G1, we provide the following story-oriented interactions (Fig.",,,,
5) that allow users to directly specify the narrative elements on the content canvas.,,,,
These interactions help construct the content tree for the automatic layout algorithm in Sect.,,,,
4.2.8.,,,,
4.2.4 Dimension I: Display of context Context mode asks users to specify words as context (E1) first: It generates a dashed contour by default.,,,,
Users lasso and drag a set of words into the context scope.,,,,
Camera mode allows users to draw a camera motion path that depicts scene switching (E2).,,,,
Those words appearing in the successive scenes will move along the drawn path.,,,,
4.2.5 Dimension II: Cast of roles Group mode enables users to lasso multiple words to generate a group (E3).,,,,
The group is highlighted with a background color based on the color of the largest word.,,,,
"Description mode (E4) allows to drag description words (e.g., weak and old) to the roles (Fig.",,,,
5).,,,,
The position and color of these description words will be updated according to the role.,,,,
4.2.6 Dimension III: Event representation Dialog mode enables users to specify a dialog (E6) between roles.,,,,
"In this mode, users first specify two speakers and lasso the dialog contents to the auto-generated arrow between two speakers.",,,,
Give mode provides another typical event (E5) design (Fig.,,,,
3a-3).,,,,
"In this mode, users need to specify the giver and receiver successively and drag the given word to the auto-generated arrow.",,,,
Words then animate from the giver to the receiver in the path.,,,,
Action mode specifies a common event (E5).,,,,
The system draws an arrow or dashed links between two specified roles to demonstrate the direction.,,,,
The words that explain the concrete events are then dragged to the arrow.,,,,
"4.2.7 Dimension IV: Visual embellishments Given G3, the system also provides interactions to enable users to incorporate visual embellishments in the animated word clouds, such as icons (E7).",,,,
"Users are allowed to change the color of the words, as well as replacing them with icons (Fig.",,,,
4c-1).,,,,
"4.2.8 Layout algorithm In accordance with G2, the system should generate layouts automatically according to different interactions.",,,,
The individual layout at each key frame should be coherent with the overall visual representation that illustrates the whole story.,,,,
"Besides, the successive word clouds should preserve temporal coherence with smooth visual transition.",,,,
"However, current algorithms to generate word clouds cannot satisfy both requirements meanwhile.",,,,
"For example, the algorithms (e.g., Vie?gas et al. 2009) pursuing compactness of word clouds cannot provide enough space for the animation.",,,,
"Second, most dynamic word clouds layouts (e.g., Cui et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2011) maintain the global coherence, whereas the word positions in our scenario only indicate the local semantics in two su,ccess,ive key f,""rames.,""",,,,
Our proposed layout algorithm is implemented based on the force-directed graph using D3.js and adapted to keep semantic relations and preserve stability in successive key frames.,,,,
"In our situation, the layout is expected to satisfy several requirements.",,,,
??R1.,,,,
"Keep the hierarchical structure of words Words in a key frame are assigned with different narrative elements, presenting a story hierarchy.",,,,
"For example, multiple roles compose a group, and a context may contain several groups.",,,,
The algorithm should ensure both words and their hierarchical structures overlapping-free.,,,,
??R2.,,,,
"Maintain relative stability of word clouds Every time we add interactions, the force-directed algorithm may generate a new layout with randomness.",,,,
To avoid meaningless animation as required in Sect.,,,,
"3.1.3, we need a stability algorithm.",,,,
??R3.,,,,
Reduce overlapping during animation The whole animation should be easy to follow and without much clutter.,,,,
"However, the force-directed algorithm can only ensure that words are not overlapped, but the motion paths of words are overlooked.",,,,
A algorithm to reduce overlaps between motion path and words is required.,,,,
"Based on these requirements, we implement an algorithm at each key frame as shown in Fig.",,,,
6,,,,
"First, we build a content tree for the words in a key frame based on a top-down approach (Fig.",,,,
6a).,,,,
Each node of this tree represents a word.,,,,
"A complete tree consists of a root node, a context layer, group layer, role layer, and description layer.",,,,
The content tree is consistent with the semantic hierarchy in the design space (R1).,,,,
"For example, the context node (E1) contains all the nodes in this context and is appended to the root node.",,,,
The child nodes of the context are the groups (E3) which are composed of multiple roles.,,,,
"We place the events (E5) at the same layer of the role layer, since events are closely related to roles and required to arrange the positions simultaneously.",,,,
"The description layer is appended to the role layer, since description (E4) provides additional information of the role.",,,,
"To maintain stability (R2), we record three pieces of information of each node: (1) the size of the word; (2) the position of the word in the previous frame (empty if it is a new word); and (3) shou,ld it,be fixed,"", determined by the word-fixed algorithm.,""",,,,
"Be default, we fix all the words.",,,,
A word will be unlocked (Fig.,,,,
"6b), if it meets any of the following conditions: (1) it is a new word; (2) it moves to another word; (3) it joins or leaves a group; (4) it moves to another context.",,,,
"Then, we implement a hierarchical force-directed algorithm (R1) in a bottom-up approach based on the constructed content tree (Fig.",,,,
6c).,,,,
We first find a subtree with a height of two and then generate a local layout for this subtree based on the force-directed algorithm.,,,,
We exert a repulsive force on every two words \x0cand a central attraction force on all words.,,,,
The weight of the repulsive force is adaptive depending on their narrative elements.,,,,
The fixed words will be locked to their original positions.,,,,
"Then, we replace this subtree with a pseudonode, of which the position and size are decided by the layout of the subtree.",,,,
"Meanwhile, we solve the word occlusion problem in each subtree following Wang et al.'s (2018a) method, where the neighboring repulsive forces push away two collided words.",,,,
The above operations are performed recursively until there is only one node in the content tree.,,,,
"At last, we re-calculate the position of each node by superimposing the relative displacement from the root node to the leaves.",,,,
"Finally, we render the motion path on the content canvas (Fig.",,,,
6d).,,,,
We propose a heuristic algorithm to derive a motion path with minimum overlapping areas (R3).,,,,
There are two situations which should render a motion path: (1) draw an arrow and (2) move the word.,,,,
The origin and destination of this path have been calculated based on the hierarchical force-directed layout.,,,,
We use a quadratic or cubic Bezier curve as the motion path between these two end points.,,,,
"Specifically, we generate several different sets of control points and produce several Bezier curves correspondingly.",,,,
"The motion path considers the size of the moving word along the curve, as shown in the blue area in Fig.",,,,
6d.,,,,
"To calculate the overlapping areas, we first judge whether there are collisions between the motion path and the words around by comparing the positions of the path border and words??rectangular vert,ices.,"","",",,,,
"When there exist collisions, we calculate approximate trapezoidal areas as the overlapping areas based on the intersections of the path border and words??rectangle.",,,,
"Finally, we choose a motion path with minimum overlapping areas with other words on its motion path.",,,,
"Although we cannot guarantee no overlapping areas, it can help alleviate the issue with relatively good performance.",,,,

"5.1 Example animated word clouds In this section, we crafted four animated stories to demonstrate the expressiveness of our tool and exemplify a diversity of usage scenarios, including fairy tales,,movie,""s, and ne"",""ws summary.,""",,,,
Examples are available at https://dancingwords.github.io/.,,,,
"With the automatic layout algorithm, DancingWords can reduce users??workload in creating animated word clouds and also demonstrate good performance (G2).",,,,
"For example, the algorithm well preserves the hierarchical structure of the contents in Fig.",,,,
7b-3.,,,,
All roles appear within the same shire context (Fig.,,,,
7b-1) and distributed according to different groups (Fig.,,,,
7b-3).,,,,
"Roles in the same group (i.e., Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, and Aragorn) gather together within the light blue background and do not interact with other groups.",,,,
"Moreover, it preserves the relative spatial coherence between leading roles among the successive key frames (e.g., Fig.",,,,
"7c-2, c-3).",,,,
The final rendering algorithm shows a promising effect.,,,,
"For example, arrows in Fig.",,,,
"7a-1, c-1 are both rendered with minimum overlapping.",,,,
"During the process, there are no obvious distracting overlaps in the videos.",,,,
"In addition, during the case studies, we find that the algorithm greatly saves the creation time so that we can put more efforts on sketching the expression, instead of adjusting the positions and l,ayout,""s.,"",",,,,
"Besides, to show the capability of our tool for crafting complex stories, we reconstructed the story from Cui et al. (2010) which summarized 20-year news about Apple.",,,,
We selected 25 most frequent words in each \x0cframe of their case figures.,,,,
Our example aims to reveal the relations of words through setting up the narrative elements and animating the dynamic process.,,,,
"In the early years, Apple was competing with Microsoft in the computer market, thus being put together in the same context (Fig.",,,,
7d-1).,,,,
"During this period, the font size of the word Microsoft was changing due to the anti-monopoly lawsuit with government and other technology companies.",,,,
"Therefore, we add a connection between Microsoft and Apple through the action mode and put related words around the link (Fig.",,,,
7d-2).,,,,
"Later, when Apple enriched the diversity of their products with iPod and iPhone, we dissolved the previous context including Microsoft and Apple (Fig.",,,,
7d-3) and created a new one for Apple only.,,,,
The design of camera moving effects (Fig.,,,,
7d-4) aims to show that people's focus on Apple was not binding with Microsoft and diverting to new aspects in music players and phones (Fig.,,,,
7d-5).,,,,
"Through the animation, we directly present the development of Apple.",,,,
"By incorporating visual embellishments (G3), DancingWords can greatly improve the quality of the final animated word clouds and engage viewers.",,,,
"For example, we add character figures in Fig.",,,,
7,,,,
The dialog bubbles are also designed to be close to animation.,,,,

The small icons on the bottom left of each key frame represent the interactions involved in the frame.,,,,
"We provide part of screenshots from our videos, and the whole animated stories can be found on the supplementary materials 5.2 Usability study To evaluate the usability of DancingWords, we conducted,a re,productio,""n study with users who did not take part in the previous study.,""",,,,
Participants We recruited 10 participants from a university.,,,,
"Seven of them are undergraduate (p1?뱎2) and postgraduate (p3?뱎7) students with text visualization experience (four males, three female; aged from 21 to 25), while the other three were students maj,ored,in Produc,""t Design (p8?뱎10) skilled in creating videos (two males, one female; aged from 20 to 24).,""",,,,
Procedure Participants were asked to complete two replication tasks on the Google Chrome browser on a PC with a 1920\x021080 display.,,,,
(1) The first task serves as a training task where participants were asked to reproduce the example video about Little Red Riding Hood.,,,,
We first provided a 10-min tutorial about our system and provided guidance timely.,,,,
"(2) The second task required participants to create animated word clouds for the story, The Emperor's New Clothes, without our assistance and example videos.",,,,
"In this task, they needed to arrange the narrative structure in the video by themselves.",,,,
We chose these two well-known \x0cstories in order to save participants??time to get familiar with stories and directly create the animated stories.,,,,
"Finally, we collected their feedback through a questionnaire using five-point Likert scale (1?봲trongly disagree, 5?봲trongly agree) and a semi-structured interview.",,,,
Results All participants completed two replication tasks in 90 min.,,,,
"Specifically, the first took \x18 30 min (including the tutorial), while the second task lasted \x18 60 min.",,,,
The time used with our system to create an animated story is greatly shorter than that designers spent in the preliminary study (5 h).,,,,
"Based on the ratings given by participants after the study, the overall feedback is promising.",,,,
"They generally were satisfied with the tool, where all scores are beyond 4 in a 5-point Likert scale.",,,,
Participants were mostly pleased with these intuitive story-oriented interactions (4.5/5) and agreed that they covered basic narrative elements (4.375/5).,,,,
"Moreover, adding visual embellishments was regarded as a useful technique to enhance the appeal (4.375/5).",,,,
It indicated the strengths of DancingWords to create animated word clouds for storytelling based on the structured design space.,,,,
The auto-layout is relatively weak (4.0/5).,,,,
Opinions for the automatic layout algorithm vary among participants.,,,,
"Most general users (p1, p3?뱎6) said that they were satisfied with the results.",,,,
"Participants with rich video-creation experience (p8?뱎10) admitted that the automatic layout algorithm could greatly reduce the workload, although it did not always promise a perfect layout.",,,,
P8 argued that he had to adjust the detailed layout by himself.,,,,
"It was reasonable that professional designers required flexibility to realize elaborate designs, which could be hard to be satisfied with auto-layouts.",,,,
"Overall, they agreed that the system could assist the creation process (4.125/5) and produce various stories (4.125/5).",,,,
"In addition, they proposed specific use cases of the generated animated stories, such as course presentation, report summarization, and quick demo.",,,,
"P9 said, ?섃쁈t allows to quickly create prototype videos for idea brainstorming and communication.?쇺?Suggestions for improvements Afterward, participants provided constructive comments on Dancin,gWord,s for fur,""ther improvements.,""",,,,
"First, they required a module to help identify words, e.g., processing text and extracting words according to the narrative elements.",,,,
"During the study, we observed that they spent much time on finding words in the left panel, since the current system asks users to decide the word relations themselves.",,,,
It could be helpful if the system provides semantic categories for words.,,,,
Another shortcoming is that the automatic layout does not always meet expectations.,,,,
Users need to re-generate the layout to achieve a better effect.,,,,
Other minor issues include incorporating more designs for contexts and events.,,,,
"6 Discussion This section discusses using animated word clouds for storytelling, as well as the implications and limitations of this work.",,,,
"6.1 Animated word clouds for storytelling In this work, we explore the possibility of animated word clouds to tell stories.",,,,
"We discuss our final representations compared to traditional word clouds, as well as the generalizability of the tool to create animated words and figures for storytelling.",,,,
"During our exploratory study, we preserve the major feature of word clouds that encode word significance into font size.",,,,
"Although it is hard to compare the size of icons and words, users prefer to replace the major characters with icons based on our observations.",,,,
"Thus, the visual significance of icons is consistent with the original data.",,,,
Another problem is that word clouds in each frame are not compact enough.,,,,
Prior studies in word clouds (Barth et al. 2014) have evaluated that semantic word clouds cannot be as compact as Wordle.,,,,
"Our work aims to reveal the narrative relations among words, which preserves semantic and temporal relations simultaneously.",,,,
Proper whitespace can help identify word groups and leave space for animation.,,,,
The goal of our current automatic layout algorithm is to satisfy the design space and does not consider the compactness.,,,,
But it is feasible to further improve the compactness after the hierarchy forcedirected algorithm.,,,,
Another emerging discussion is about applying the tool to create animated words and figures for storytelling.,,,,
"The integration of figures and words in animated storytelling not only preserves the readability of text, but also increases the appeal and retention with figures.",,,,
"DancingWords provides an easy authoring of animated words and figures, which is appreciated during the user study.",,,,
"Moreover, we can improve the generalizability by enriching the designs of different narrative elements.",,,,
"For example, besides basic arrows to display action events (E5), the tool can provide more alternative designs or allow users to upload their own figures to convey the event.",,,,
Future work can also explore how users combine words and icons for storytelling and improve the tool iteratively.,,,,
6.2 Implications and limitations Implications The entire design process from understanding the design space to developing a proof-ofconcept authoring tool has shown several implications.,,,,
"First, our own trials to produce examples of animated word clouds provide a preliminary characterization of the problem domain.",,,,
Communicating stories with animated word clouds has a large design space given the variety of visual designs and narrative elements.,,,,
We narrowed down to three essential elements which can compose a typical story based on literature review and our own practice.,,,,
We further validated our designs and enriched the space by cooperating with designers.,,,,
The iterative brainstorming and discussions distilled the design space and illuminated the authoring tool.,,,,
"Second, this work presents a storytelling authoring tool for general users.",,,,
It follows a structure-based design paradigm that encapsulates common interactions in line with identified narrative elements.,,,,
Users are able to directly interact with narrative elements and quickly produce animated stories.,,,,
Limitations Our work has several limitations.,,,,
"First, the performance of these generated animated word clouds should be further evaluated.",,,,
The experts and designers in the exploratory study have agreed that current narrative elements show the structure of stories.,,,,
Participants in the usability study validate that using current designs is able to generate animated stories.,,,,
"However, the number of these participants is limited.",,,,
A further study with a broad range of viewers for specific animation effects should be conducted in the future.,,,,
"Second, the automatic layout algorithm is based on a heuristic method.",,,,
We define and modify the different levels of forces through multiple iterations to achieve an expected result.,,,,
Further extension of the current algorithm could be explored to support a more reasonable weight adjustment.,,,,
"Third, DancingWords currently requires manual efforts to select words.",,,,
"Incorporating advanced machine learning methods or NLP algorithms (Zhou 2019; Chawla et al. 2020) to help preprocess documents and extract relations (Yang et al. 2017; Wong and Zhang 2018; Xia et al,. 201,6) is wor,""th studying.,""",,,,
"7 Conclusion In this paper, we explore the possible designs in animated word clouds to tell stories.",,,,
"Through a systematic iterative approach with designers, we collect examples of animated word clouds and summarize the design space for different narrative elements.",,,,
"Based on the design space, we further implement an authoring tool, DancingWords, which incorporates a set of intuitive interactions for users to directly manipulate the narrative elements and provid,es an,automati,""c algorithm to adjust the layout.,""",,,,
The expressiveness and usability of the tool are demonstrated through example animated stories and a reproduction user study.,,,,
There are several avenues for future work.,,,,
"First, we plan to deploy DancingWords on a public website and collect a broader range of examples from general users, as well as their comments for such animated word clouds.",,,,
"Second, we intend to incorporate advanced NLP algorithms or sentiment analysis methods into the tool, which can help extract the outline of stories and recommend words.",,,,
"Plexus: An Interactive Visualization Tool for Analyzing Public Emotions from Twitter Data ABSTRACT RELATED WORK Social media is often used by researchers as an approach to obtaining real-time data o,n peo,ple's ac,""tivities and thoughts.,""",,,,
"Twitter, as one of the most popular social networking services nowadays, provides copious information streams on various topics and events.",,,,
Mining and analyzing Tweets enable us to find public reactions and emotions to activities or objects.,,,,
This paper presents an interactive visualization tool that identifies and visualizes people's emotions on any two related topics by streaming and processing data from Twitter.,,,,
The effectiveness of this visualization was evaluated and demonstrated by a feasibility study with 14 participants.,,,,
"In recent years, social networks have become a hot field for statistician, visual analysts, finance researchers etc.",,,,
There are lots of research explorations of analyzing and visualizing data from Twitter.,,,,
The following two fields are closely connected to the scope of our study.,,,,
"Author Keywords Social media, Visualization, Affective Computing, Visual analytics, User interfaces.",,,,
"INTRODUCTION As of August 2013, there are more than 500 million Tweets posted a day, which means about 5,700 Tweets per second [5].",,,,
The contents from social media can be used as an approach to analyzing the patterns of languages.,,,,
Textual data from Twitter streams contains uncountable amount of valuable information for lots of areas.,,,,
"By developing visualization of the textual data retrieved from thousands of tweets, we can see not only simple attributes like word frequency, but also the underlying connections of different topics,and,opinions.,"",""",,,,
The goal of this project is to design and to create a visualization tool using Java to present the semantic analysis results of a large amount of tweets with two topics inputted by a user.,,,,
"The idea is to categorize and to display tweets that are the most related to the emotions in a creative and efficient way so that users can understand the connections between these topics and the ma,in su,""bject.,"",",,,,
This project will be also beneficial for researchers who are interested in researching and predicting public opinions from social media.,,,,
"After retrieving data via the official Twitter developer API, the contents will be processed and analyzed and the visualization will display the real-time analysis results as the program is running.,"","",,",,,,
A.,,,,
Topic Alignment Topic detection and modelling are the first step for many Twitter visualizations.,,,,
"Malik et al had created TopicFlow, a toolkit for statistical topic modelling and alignment [7].",,,,
It can detect the topics and present them as binned topic models.,,,,
TopicFlow was designed to discover the evolution of topics over time from Twitter streams.,,,,
Hussain et al [2] use powerlaw graphs to connect all the topics in semantic nets.,,,,
The node set of a graph is divided into power and non-power nodes and then they are grouped into multiple clusters that are connected to others.,,,,
B.,,,,
Knowledge Visualization Our research project fundamentally revolves around information visualization.,,,,
Liu et al [6] built a knowledge graph by extracting the information structure from Twitter stream and added a semantic dimension.,,,,
Trees are created and added by connecting the mapped nodes of the knowledge graph.,,,,
MODULES Plexus is essentially written with three main modules to produce a complete visualization.,,,,
1,,,,
"Data Processing Twitter4J [15], an unofficial Java library for the Twitter API, processes all the search queries from Twitter.",,,,
2,,,,
"Emotion Analysis Johnson-laird and Oatley [3] produced a theory that there are five basic emotion modes: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust, and other emotional states are only subsets of,these,five emo,""tions.,""",,,,
"Because all emotions are based on the five basic families of emotion modes, this theory states that a word can attribute to more than one emotion modes.",,,,
"Therefore, categorizing a word or text to a single emotion is oftentimes inappropriate.",,,,
"For texts with complex emotions, a quantitative analysis for all five emotion modes is significant for the accuracy of the investigation.",,,,
"The emotion analysis module in this software is based on the AlchemyLanguage service from IBM [12], which offers a collection of functions and APIs for natural language processing and analysis.",,,,
The Emotion Analysis function can analyze any textual information in English and return the detected emotions and their relevance values.,,,,
"It can not only analyze the overall emotions of an entire text, but also find out the emotions associated with individual entities or keywords which are also identified by AlchemyLanguage.",,,,
"The relevance values returned along with five emotions indicate the confidence levels for each of them, making it convenient for developers to quantify the emotions.",,,,
dynamic interaction networks for various types of data and handles the graph evolution in time [10].,,,,
The changes and transformations of the network can be observed while the program is modeling and visualizing data.,,,,
"SOFTWARE DESIGN Java, the programming language used for this visualization tool, is an objective-oriented language.",,,,
The software design was expected to accomplish a high cohesion and low coupling among the fundamental modules of Plexus.,,,,
"Three classes were created to perform the visualization tasks, along with two other property files.",,,,
1,,,,
TwitterVis TwitterVis is the main class in this software package.,,,,
The keywords in the Twitter API search query are defined in this class.,,,,
TwitterVis retrieves the data according to the given keywords and pass them to the GetEmotion class for emotion analysis.,,,,
2,,,,
GetEmotion GetEmotion submits streamed tweets to the AlchemyAPI service and utilizes a HashMap function to find the emotion mode with the largest relevance value.,,,,
3,,,,
Greetings Greetings provides a simple GUI for users to input two related topics that they are interested in learning through this visualization.,,,,
The visualization module will initiate after users hit the ?쐓ubmit??button.,,,,
"The emotion analysis results returned from AlchemyLanguage are in a JSON format, but they are not native JSON objects.",,,,
"JSON-java, a popular JSON package in Java, was used to convert the emotion results to a JSON object.",,,,
"This object is parsed to read the values of each emotion and assign them to five double variables (joyValue, angerValue, fearValue, disgustValue, sadnessValue).",,,,
A method called getFinalEmootion was created in the GetEmotion class to return the most relevant emotion of a text based on those five created variables.,,,,
"In this function, a HashMap was created to store the names and values of emotions.",,,,
I found HashMap is probably the easiest way to find the one with the maximum value out of five variables.,,,,
"It can be used to find either the maximum value or the key with the maximum, or both.",,,,
"If I only need to find the maximum of five values, I can do a multiple comparison using Math.Max [13]: There are many software toolkits and libraries available for visualization in Java, including P,refus,""e, Piccol"",""o2D, JUNG, Graphviz, and Gephi.,""",,,,
Eventually GraphStream was chosen and used to create interactive visualizations for this project.,,,,
GraphStream is an open-source Java library for modeling and visualizing data in the form of dynamic graphs.,,,,
It shows 4.,,,,
"TwitterDevApiKey TwitterDevApiKey stores all the credential information, i.e.",,,,
"API tokens and keys, in the program.",,,,
The reason for this design is that putting all keys in the same location makes it convenient to organize and update the license information in this package.,,,,
5,,,,
Stylesheet (CSS) The stylesheet file was created to establish a styling framework for this visualization.,,,,
All elements??properties are defined here.,,,,
"Separate styles for users??actions, such like clicking a node, can also be declared here.",,,,
"The entire stylesheet was written in CSS so that styles of HTML elements can be directly adapted into Plexus, a Java program.",,,,
VISUALIZATION DESIGN A basic goal of visualizing information is to tell a story or solve a problem [14].,,,,
"To create an effective visualization, several factors such as spatial position need to be considered.",,,,
"Plexus provides a simple 2D model to have the visualization results presented as a force-directed network graph, in which two clusters are embedded.",,,,
"From the perspective of visualization, force-directed algorithms create graphs that are aesthetically engaging [9] and interactively intriguing.",,,,
Since the goal of this visualization design is to create a social media data visualization for users without much prior experience or knowledge in this field.,,,,
The biggest challenge for the force-directed approach is that it does not perform well as the number of vertices increases.,,,,
"In other words, producing force-directed algorithms tends to be slow and laggy, and the layouts generated are satisfactory.",,,,
Another issue that occurred in this project is that the details of individual nodes are difficult to be read as the density of each cluster increases.,,,,
This can be solved by adjusting the size of nodes in the stylesheet.,,,,
"However, the layout would get messier this way because the algorithm used to produce the force-directed graph calculated the distances between nodes, i.e.",,,,
"the lengths of edges, automatically.",,,,
Striking a balance of information content and the readability of details is a research problem that occurs to us often when designing the visualization.,,,,
1,,,,
Structure The initiative of this project was to build a visualization tool that is intuitively simple for users to use and understand without reading values and charts.,,,,
The visualization is designed to be able to qualitatively present an overview of people's thoughts and reactions to certain topics.,,,,
"Therefore, the structure of data processing is made concise and rational.",,,,
"Figure 2 shows the main framework of Plexus, which compares two topics inputted by users, along with several nodes serving as emotions respectively.",,,,
Each emotion node (the colored circles) has some Tweets whose textual emotion corresponds with the emotion nodes.,,,,
The colors picked in Figure 3 were implemented in the visualization and the result is shown in Figure 4.,,,,

Color Colors for many people are an essential way of presenting information.,,,,
People's perceptions and interpretations on information are affected by colors.,,,,
"In this visualization, five colors are carefully picked based on several psychologists??[4] and HCI researcher's study [8] to represent the five essential emotions.",,,,
The connection between each color and emotion was evaluated to be valid by 14 participants.,,,,
This set of colors is both informational and contrasting so that a user should be able to differentiate between them in the entire visualization.,,,,
Using colors to represent emotions is effective.,,,,
"However, there are still improvement possibilities for emotion representation.",,,,
"Many design techniques, including the fundamental psychological approaches that use dimensional and componential emotion processes [1], are available to server as mediums of the meanings of emotions,"".,"",,",,,,
An attempt of using Emoji icons was made to improve users??perceptions on emotions.,,,,
"Five icons from Emoji One, an open-source emoji font, were used and modified to adapt to the new design.",,,,
This new design modification has intuitively made the visualization more explicit.,,,,
Figure 5 shows how the colors and Emoji icons merge into one element.,,,,
could understand and describe the meaning of the visualization without much prior explanation.,,,,
Many of them gave us insightful feedbacks and helpful suggestions.,,,,
"From their suggestions, we will further revise our design of the emoji icons to make the faces more explicit in the context of the dynamic visualization.",,,,
FUTURE WORK Figure 5 Redesigned Emoji Icons Based on the Five Picked Colors 4.,,,,
Elements The styling details of this visualization are defined in a single CSS stylesheet that is read by the GraphStream library.,,,,
"Many options and properties are available for configuring and customizing the style of visualization elements, which are nodes, edges, and the overall graph.",,,,
The improved visualization based on the modified Emoji icons is shown in Figure 6.,,,,
This project has presented an early-stage yet fully functional prototype of an interactive visualization for real-time data from Twitter.,,,,
"There are lots of possibilities for us to explore in terms of data mining, affective computing and visual analytics.",,,,
The next-stage development of Plexus includes two aspects: function and visual design.,,,,
"Function A bountiful amount of information hidden or embedded with tweets is returned every time a data retrieval call happens, including geolocation, language of tweet entries, users??language pref,erenc,""es, and t"",""ime.,""",,,,
Plexus can be made more powerful by utilizing these types of information effectively.,,,,
Several new functions or modules can be added for Plexus to make this software more versatile.,,,,
1,,,,
Map The search operator for geolocalization returns precise results by defining the geocode parameter in the search query [11].,,,,
"The Twitter Search API will look for Tweets from this defined location, or Tweets created by users from this given location if the first option does not return valid results.",,,,
"Thus, by constructing and embedding a map in Plexus, users can investigate the emotions of people from different places to the given topics.",,,,
"For instance, users can explore how the reactions of people from Vancouver and New York City differ in terms of the U.S. presidential election that happened recently.",,,,
2,,,,
Time Series Processing Twitter data to a time series will enable users to observe how public emotions to specific topics are changing over time.,,,,
The Tweets retrieved will be categorized by dates and then get processed.,,,,
A time axis will be added at the bottom of the graph to be manipulated easily by dragging the arrow to choose the year that a user is interested in inspecting.,,,,
"Figure 6 New Visualization with Emoji Icons Compares People's Emotions to iPhone 7 and Samsung S7 FEASIBILITY STUDY A feasibility study was conducted with 14 participants to understand users??perce,ption,s and com,""prehensions on the visualization results in Plexus.,""",,,,
They are all graduate students from the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University.,,,,
Participants were asked to watch a demo video of using Plexus and to describe the information they learned after observing the complete visualization process.,,,,
The usability of this visualization was evaluated through these informal oral surveys.,,,,
"Results show that all of them Visual Design This visualization can be made more user-friendly after improving the design for the elements, including the shapes of different types of nodes and the co,lors,of edges.,"",""",,,,
CONCLUSION The overall motivation for this research is to design a visualization tool to solve the problem of information overloading on social media.,,,,
Our study is primarily an attempted exploration of visual analytics based on social network services.,,,,
"The tool we developed, Plexus, managed to foster average users??engagement in learning about topics \x0cthat they are interested in by using Twitter data.",,,,
We proposed and realized a functional visualization tool successfully and the results we got from it are significant for us to understand people's reactions to certain topics.,,,,

"In this paper, we present IdeaFlow, a visual analytics system for analyzing the leadlag changes within and across pre-defined social groups regarding a specific set of correlated ideas, each of whic,h is,described,""by a set of words.,""",,,,
"To model idea flows accurately, we develop a randomwalk-based correlation model and integrate it with Bayesian conditional cointegration and a tensor-based technique.",,,,
"To convey complex lead-lag relationships over time, IdeaFlow combines the strengths of a bubble tree, a flow map, and a timeline.",,,,
"In particular, we develop a Voronoi-treemap-based bubble tree to help users get an overview of a set of ideas quickly.",,,,
A correlated-clustering-based layout algorithm is used to simultaneously generate multiple flow maps with less ambiguity.,,,,
We also introduce a focus+context timeline to explore huge amounts of temporal data at different levels of time granularity.,,,,
Quantitative evaluation and case studies demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of IdeaFlow.,,,,

"Some ideas are very enduring and energetic, and can flow within and across multiple social groups over a long period of time, while other ideas are quite ephemeral and stagnant, and can only stay wi,thin,a specifi,""c group of users for a limited period of time.,""",,,,
"Tracking the way ideas flow on social media is of theoretical and practical significance for social scientists, policy-makers, and business managers, because it can enrich our knowledge about the em,ergen,ce and ev,""olution of a social idea, advance our understanding of the convergence and divergence of multiple social ideas, and sharpen our insights into the roles of various social groups in the idea flow process.,""",,,,
"For example, public health researchers often analyze emerging health threats like Ebola and aim to develop an efficient and effective action plan to tackle such threats.",,,,
"By analyzing the lead-lag relationships between a set of correlated ideas mined from the Ebola dataset, they can identify the most influential social groups and make suggestions to the government.",,,,
The lead-lag relationships refer to instances where an idea discussed by individuals in group A (lead) is followed by those in group B (lags).,,,,
Correlation is a statistical technique that shows whether and how strongly pairs of variables are related [52].,,,,
"In our work, two ideas are correlated if they frequently propagate information concerning each other (measured by meta-data such as re-tweets), have similar content, and/or exhibit similar temporal,chang,es in ter,""ms of given quantitative values such as word frequency.,""",,,,
"Compared with topics, ideas are more correlated with each other.",,,,
Another example is to disclose the leadership and impact of different groups of individuals on multiple social issues.,,,,
The idea flows among such individuals can reveal the lead and lag relationships between political parties on a set of correlated ideas.,,,,

"Driven by these applications, there is an increasing demand in scholarly and practical research to track such idea flows, especially the lead-lag relationships, within and across groups.",,,,
Tracking idea flows from the huge amount of data collected on social media is technically demanding.,,,,
There are two major challenges that we need to address.,,,,
One is to model ideas and track their lead-lag relationships over time.,,,,
Existing methods either employ word-based tweet content [21] or cointegration between word time series [53] to model idea flows.,,,,
"Generally, the model accuracy is unsatisfactory.",,,,
"Moreover, in real-world applications, it is desirable to track the lead-lag changes across multiple social groups regarding a specific set of correlated ideas.",,,,
"Due to the lack of a consistent method to jointly estimate lead-lag relationships from multiple social groups, the existing methods either track correlated idea flows between two groups [53] or mode,l lea,d-lag rel,""ationships among multiple groups on a specific idea instead of a set of correlated ideas [21].,""",,,,
The second challenge is to design an intuitive visualization to illustrate idea flows across a long time span.,,,,
The idea flow model often produces hundreds of ideas and thousands of leadlag relationships.,,,,
Trying to display all of them at once will cause visual clutter and ambiguity.,,,,
"Furthermore, a dataset may contain thousands of time points.",,,,
"As such, an easy-to-understand metaphor is necessary to efficiently and effectively represent the idea flow over a long timeframe, which allows experts to focus on a selected time period of interest,whil,e keeping,""others in context.,""",,,,
"We have developed a visual analytics system, IdeaFlow, to tackle these challenges.",,,,
"To model idea flows accurately, we have developed a random-walk-based correlation model and integrated it with Bayesian conditional cointegration [5] and a tensor-based technique [18].",,,,
"Specifically, we first calculate correlations between word time series by using Bayesian conditional cointegration.",,,,
"The correlations between word time series are then fed into the random-walk-based correlation model, which combines correlations between word time series, the tweet content, and meta-data (e.g., re-,tweet,s) to gen,""erate more accurate temporal correlations of words.,""",,,,
"Next, we use tensor decomposition to cluster the words into ideas and aggregate the temporal correlations between words into lead-lag relationships.",,,,
"To effectively convey complex lead-lag relationships, we have developed a visualization that combines the strengths of a Voronoi-treemap-based bubble tree, a flow map, and a timeline.",,,,
"In particular, we have developed a Voronoi-treemap-based bubble tree to help users quickly get an overview of a set of ideas.",,,,
A correlated-clustering-based layout algorithm is used to simultaneously generate multiple flow maps with less ambiguity.,,,,
We have also introduced a focus+context timeline to explore huge amounts of temporal data at different levels of time granularity.,,,,
"Based on the three visualizations, IdeaFlow offers multiple coordinated visualizations facilitated by interactive explorations.",,,,
"The major contributions of this work are: ??A visual analytics system that helps experts understand and analyze the lead-lag changes within and across social groups regarding a specific set of corre,lated,""ideas.,"",",,,,
"??A correlation model that substantially improves model accuracy by taking into account the tweet content, meta-data, and the cointegration between word time series.",,,,
"??A coordinated visualization that combines the strengths of a correlated-clustering-based flow map, a focus+context timeline, and a Voronoi-treemap-based bubble tree to convey leadlag at different,level,s of gran,""ularity and with less ambiguity.,""",,,,
2 R ELATED W ORK 2.1 Mining Lead-lag Relationships Our idea flow tracking algorithm is related to lead-lag analysis.,,,,
"Current literature on lead-lag analysis can be classified into two cate- gories: global lead-lag analysis that models lead-lag relationships across all time points and local lead-lag analysis that m,odels,leadlag,""relationships at each time point.,""",,,,
"Global lead-lag analysis methods [19, 48] have achieved a certain amount of success in identifying leading (or most influential) corpora and documents.",,,,
"However, they are not able to detect local lead-lag changes over time.",,,,
"Recently, some local lead-lag analysis methods have been developed.",,,,
"For example, TextPioneer [21] learns local lead-lag relationships among multiple corpora by calculating the content correlation at different time points.",,,,
"More specifically, corpus A is considered to be the local lead at time point t if its content at t is more similar to the future rather than the past content of corpus B.",,,,
"However, this method only detects the lead-lag changes of the same topic.",,,,
Zhong et al. [53] modeled local lead-lag relationships of a set of correlated ideas by detecting the cointegration between word time series.,,,,
"Specifically, they represented each word by a time series that encodes its frequency change over time.",,,,
Two word time series are considered to be cointegrated (or correlated) in a time period if they have a stationary linear combination during that period.,,,,
"However, this method limits the learning of the lead-lag relationships to only two groups.",,,,
"Compared with this method, our model is able to detect local lead-lag changes within or across multiple groups on a set of correlated ideas.",,,,
"Our method substantially improves the model accuracy by developing a random-walk-based correlation model in which the content, meta-data (e.g., follower-followee relationships), and correlations bet,ween,word time,""series are taken into account.,""",,,,
"Furthermore, we have developed a visual analytics system that empowers users to better analyze and understand lead-lag changes within and across multiple groups.",,,,
"2.2 Visual Analysis of Topic Influence The problem of visually tracking and analyzing topic evolution in large text corpora has received considerable attention in recent years [22, 27, 38].",,,,
"For example, TIARA [26, 35] and Visual Backchannel [11] visually depict how topics or text clusters evolve over time using a river metaphor.",,,,
"HierarchicalTopics [14] extracts hierarchical structures of topics using Bayesian rose trees [23, 37] and visually tracks their temporal changes in a hierarchical ThemeRiver visualization.",,,,
ParallelTopics [12] integrates an LDA topicmodeling algorithm with a parallel coordinate metaphor to represent document topic distributions and their temporal evolution.,,,,
The evolving topics may be correlated with other topics over time by a variety of relationships.,,,,
"The most interesting relationships are topic popularity [13, 28], topic competition and collation [39, 50], and topic merging and splitting [8, 9, 15, 25].",,,,
"For example, EventRiver [28] and Leadline [13] visually depict the temporal popularity of document clusters (known as events) in a text corpus.",,,,
"Some recent research focuses on visually analyzing the competition relationships among topics [50], as well as the coopetition [39] of topics as their influence on public attention.",,,,
They were visually conveyed in time-based flow visualizations.,,,,
TextFlow [8] was developed to visually convey topic splitting/merging patterns over time using a flow metaphor.,,,,
"Later, this work was extended to analyze the complex splitting and merging patterns of hierarchical topics [9] and text streams [25].",,,,
"Storyline visualization [24, 41, 42] was developed to depict dynamic social interactions in a story or an event, over time.",,,,
"Recently, ThemeDelta [15] was developed to identify significant topic shifts by analyzing how trend keywords converge into topics and diverge into different topics.",,,,
"SocialHelix [7] used DNA helices to visually convey sentiment trends (e.g., divergences and co-occurrences) of online communities.",,,,
"However, these approaches cannot be directly applied to analyze idea flows across multiple groups, as they do not explicitly model the lead-lag relationships on topics.",,,,
"Furthermore, the visualizations employed by these approaches are not favorably situated for comparing multiple idea flows over a large number of time points.",,,,
"Compared \x0cwith these approaches, our work focuses on modeling ideas and identifying their lead-lag relationships within/across multiple social groups.",,,,
"We also improve the scalability and flexibility of the exploration by integrating the strengths of a Voronoi-treemapbased bubble tree, a correlated-clustering-based flow map, and a focus+context tim,eline,"".,"",",,,,
"The approach closest to IdeaFlow is TextPioneer [21], which explores the lead-lag relationships among multiple text corpora on hierarchical topics.",,,,
The differences between our work and TextPioneer are as follows.,,,,
"First, TextPioneer examines lead-lag with regards to one specific topic (e.g., an economy-related topic) across groups, while our system identifies lead-lag relationships between a set of different,but c,orrelated,""ideas (e.g., a healthcare-related idea and a medical-insurance-related idea) within and across groups.,""",,,,
"Second, TextPioneer only employs word-based content to model the lead-lag relationships and the model accuracy is not satisfactory.",,,,
"Compared with this method, we have developed a correlation model that combines correlations between word time series, the tweet content, and meta-data to generate a more accurate temporal correlatio,n of,""words.,"",",,,,
The evaluation in Sec.,,,,
6 demonstrates that the model accuracy is significantly improved.,,,,

"3 D ESIGN OF I DEA F LOW Following the nested model described in [30], IdeaFlow was designed through an iterative process with three phases.",,,,
"In the first phase, two domain experts, a professor in media and communications (P1) and a professor in public health (P2), were interviewed regarding their research related to social media.",,,,
The interviews lasted about one hour each.,,,,
"During the interviews, we learned about the analysis questions, analytic process, and major challenges of concern to the experts.",,,,
"Based on this information, we extracted a set of requirements for IdeaFlow.",,,,
"In the second phase, a prototype based on the requirements was designed, developed, and refined through a set of interviews with the experts.",,,,
This iterative process took about six months.,,,,
Alternative designs (such as edge bundling for visualizing the lead-lag relationships) and individual components of the prototype were evaluated by the experts.,,,,
"In the third phase, preliminary case studies were conducted by the visualization experts and presented to the domain experts as a demo.",,,,
"After watching the demo, the domain experts explored their own datasets with the visualization experts using the prototype (P1 spent two hours and P2 spent one hour).",,,,
"Afterwards, the domain experts evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of the system as a whole.",,,,
3.1 Analytical Process and Challenges Analysis questions.,,,,
"P1 and P2 studied political communications and health threats, respectively.",,,,
"In the first phase interview, P1 talked about how he studied the discussions and debates among U.S. congress members, while P2 focused her study on the Ebola outbreak.",,,,
"Both experts claimed that their studies were driven by investigating social issues and their interactions based on who, what, and when, which was referred to by P1 as exploring the Lasswellian quest,ions,in commun,""ication research [44].,""",,,,
Detailed analysis questions are listed along with the extracted requirements in Section 3.2.,,,,
Analytical process and challenges.,,,,
"In their studies, both experts need to extract relevant social issues from the unstructured Twitter data and examine how multiple social issues would interact with one another on Twitter and how suc,h int,eractions,""would evolve over time.,""",,,,
"Moreover, they are interested in identifying influential users and institutions that would initiate the discussion and drive the changes in the discussion of an issue.",,,,
"To implement these tasks in their current practice, the experts use keyword searches to extract relevant tweets, manually code a large number of tweets, and summarize the social issues and track the,inte,ractions,""among relevant issues.,""",,,,
This process involves a large amount of human effort and important information may be missed in this labor-intensive manual process.,,,,
"The experts agreed that there was a direct mapping between a ?쐓ocial issue??and an ?쐇dea??in our approach and that the lead-lag relationships within and across social groups reflect the interactio,ns an,d influen,""ce of social issues.,""",,,,
"3.2 Design Requirements By abstracting the insights derived from the interview, we distilled the following requirements for the visual analytics system.",,,,
R1.,,,,
Generating an overview of ideas.,,,,
"The experts said they often started their analysis by turning the unstructured raw data into a structured, meaningful overview.",,,,
The overview consists of descriptions of a set of ideas and their global lead-lag relationships.,,,,
"In particular, the experts identified the following needs: R1.1.",,,,
Summarizing ideas and discovering their global lead-lag relationships.,,,,
"In particular, the system should automatically extract meaningful ideas and global lead-lag relationships and present the information to the experts in a manageable manner.",,,,
This requirement was derived from the analysis questions of the experts such as: ?쏦ow many categories of ideas are there in the data?,,,,
What is their major focus?,,,,
Which social groups take the lead in these ideas?,,,,
"What are the overall patterns of lead-lag relationships???The answers to these types of questions enable experts to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and quickly identify ideas and l,ead-l,ag relati,""onships of interest.,""",,,,
R1.2.,,,,
Examining ideas at different levels of granularity.,,,,
"The experts said in their current practice, it is a natural process to aggregate and disaggregate the ideas.",,,,
"P1 said it is of limited theoretical significance if the system focused on the aggregated ideas (e.g., economy) only.",,,,
"Instead, they were more interested in some concrete sub-ideas (e.g., healthcare, medical insurance) underlying an abstract idea.",,,,
"However, when they analyzed the data, they preferred to start with aggregated ideas first and then decompose high-level patterns to low-level patterns.",,,,
R2.,,,,
Exploring idea flows.,,,,
Developing a comprehensive understanding of interactions between ideas is among the major concerns of the experts??studies.,,,,
"Accordingly, the following requirements are proposed for exploring correlated ideas and their interactions: R2.1.",,,,
Tracking local lead-lag relationships within/across groups on a set of correlated ideas.,,,,
"Correlated ideas would interact with each other, which can enhance social influence of specific social groups on some ideas [31].",,,,
"During their research, the experts often study analysis questions such as: ?쏻hich social groups took the lead during different time periods such as the weekend / weekdays / voting period / flaring,up pe,""riod?,"",",,,,
Did the lead-lag relationships change during different phases of an election (or Ebola outbreak) or did they remain stable?,,,,
??R2.2.,,,,
"Exploring and comparing idea flows at different levels of detail (time, social group).",,,,
"First, tracking and comparing local lead- lag relationships over time addresses the aspect of ?쐗hen??in the Lasswellian questions, allowing the experts to identify global trends of idea flows and i,ntere,sting lea,""d or lag relationships (e.g., a lead relationship with high importance).,""",,,,
"After multiple interesting lead or lag relationships are detected, experts often need to decompose and compare them at finer granularity (e.g., by week or by day).",,,,
"Second, in many applications, social groups are naturally organized in a hierarchy.",,,,
"Accordingly, the experts need to compare idea flows at different levels of the group hierarchy.",,,,
"For example, professor P1 said, ?쏧n my current research, I need to compare ideas between Democrats and Republicans.",,,,
"Within each party, I am also curious about the flow behaviors between House Representatives and Senators.??R2.3.",,,,
Identifying influential social groups.,,,,

"Overall, which social groups are most influential???R3.",,,,
Exploring details.,,,,
"When describing their analytic process, both experts emphasized the importance of accessing and exploring source data in full detail.",,,,
Such a detailed examination is important for pattern exploration and hypothesis development and testing.,,,,
"Accordingly, the system should support: R3.1.",,,,
Exploring the key content.,,,,
"To understand an idea or a leadlag relationship, it is critical to access the key content, including the tweets and keywords to depict the idea or the lead/lag behavior.",,,,
This requirement was derived from analysis questions such as: ?쏛re there any tweets that can indicate the lead-lag relationships?,,,,
Which keywords are associated with the lead-lag change???R3.2.,,,,
Identifying the key users and understanding their roles.,,,,
"The experts also said identifying the key users who drove the evolution of lead-lag relationships is one of their most important tasks, as it can allow policymakers and industrial practitioners (e.g,""., PR"",professi,""onals) to take appropriate action at niche time points to control or expedite the evolution.,""",,,,
Typical analysis questions are: ?쏻ho are the key players in this idea?,,,,
"Who played the key role in this lead-lag relationship???3.3 System Overview Based on the aforementioned requirements, we have developed IdeaFlow, which consists of three modules: a lead-lag analyzer,"", a h"",ierarchy,""builder, and lead-lag visualization (Fig.,""",,,,
2).,,,,
"Given a set of tweets and the corresponding meta-data, the lead-lag analyzer models ideas and their lead-lag relationships within/across social groups.",,,,
"To enable users to examine the ideas and their lead-lag relationships at different levels of granularity, the hierarchy builder constructs hierarchies for ideas, social groups and time.",,,,
"The analysis results and the hierarchies are then passed to the lead-lag visualization module, which contains three major visual components.",,,,
"A bubble tree is designed to display the overall idea structure (R1.1, R1.2).",,,,
"A correlated-clustering-based flow map visualization is developed to depict the correlated ideas and their lead-lag relationships within and across groups over time (R2.1, R2.3).",,,,
It is coupled with a multi-focus timeline to enable a flexible exploration of the time dimension (R2.2).,,,,
"The system also provides several interactions for exploring and comparing detailed information (R3.1, R3.2).",,,,
"4 T RACKING I DEA F LOWS In this section, we introduce our algorithm to detect ideas and track their flows within and across multiple social groups.",,,,
"4.1 Basic Idea To model idea flows within and across multiple groups, we need to derive lead-lag relationships between ideas from multiple groups.",,,,

"As a result, the key is to learn the leadlag relationships between ideas.",,,,
"Since each idea is described by a set of words, lead-lag relationships between ideas can be derived by aggregating the temporal correlations between words.",,,,
"Based on this observation, we develop an idea flow tracking algorithm that consists of the following steps.",,,,
??Augmented word graph construction.,,,,
"In this step, we build an augmented word graph by extracting temporal correlations between words.",,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"3(a), each vertex in the graph represents a word from a specific group.",,,,
"Compared with a traditional graph, the edge in the augmented graph encodes the temporal correlations between two words, which is represented by a correlation vector c = [c1 , ..., cT ] and a leadlag,vect,or ?냪 =,""[?냪1 , ..., ?냪T ].,""",,,,
??Identification of ideas and their flows.,,,,
"In this step, ideas are derived by partitioning the augmented word graph (Fig.",,,,
3(b)).,,,,
Then we aggregate the temporal correlations between words into lead-lag relationships between ideas.,,,,
"4.2 Augmented Word Graph Construction Given N social groups and M words, each word from a specific social group is regarded as a vertex vmn (1 ??n ??N, 1 ??m ??M ) in the augmented graph.",,,,
"Accordingly, the goal of augmented word graph construction is to derive accurate temporal correlations between two vertices.",,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"3, the temporal correlations consist of a correlation vector c = [c1 , ..., cT ] and a lead-lag vector ?냪 = [?냪1 , ..., ?냪T ].",,,,
"Here, T is the number of time points, ck denotes the correlations between the vertices at the kth time point, and ?냪k represents the lead-lag time between the vertices at the kth time point.",,,,
The key challenge is to accurately calculate the temporal correlations between words.,,,,
"To this end, we have developed a randomwalk-based correlation model that takes into account tweet count, meta-data, and stationary behavior between word time series.",,,,
Our model is inspired by a three-level mutual reinforcement model [20] used in information retrieval.,,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"4, the correlation model consists of three graphs (i.e., user graph, tweet graph, and word graph) and the links between the graphs.",,,,
"The user graph, tweet graph, and word graph are built based on the follower-followee relationships, retweets, and cointegration [5] between word time series, respectively.",,,,
The links between the graphs 훯킵휒?힆휂훯킷? 휂탐킷흶? \x0cThen we employ a tensor decomposition technique called greedy PARAFAC [18] to derive a feature vector for each word.,,,,
"Finally, we leverage non-negative matrix factorization [51] to detect word clusters based on the feature vectors.",,,,
Each word cluster is an idea.,,,,
The correlation between two ideas is calculated by summing up correlations between words: c = ??c .,,,,
The lead-lag time between two ideas at the kth time point is calculated by the weighted average of lead-lag time between words at the kth time point: ?냪k = ??ck ?냪k )/ ??ck .,,,,
are generated based on the tweet content and authorship.,,,,
"Specifically, we link each user to the tweets s/he posted and the words s/ he mentioned (authorship).",,,,
Each tweet is also linked to the words it contains (tweet content).,,,,
"At each time k, we build a correlation model based on the tweets posted during [k, k + ? ].",,,,
Here ? is the maximum allowable lead-lag time.,,,,
"Next, we introduce how to derive ck and ?냪k based on the correlation model.",,,,
Suppose we need to calculate ck and ?냪k between v1A and v1B.,,,,
"If v1A and v1B are correlated at the kth time point, a short random walk that starts from v1A should reach v1B frequently [34].",,,,
"Based on this idea, our method is divided into three steps.",,,,
"First, we perform a series of random walks on v1A.",,,,
A random walk is a path that consists of a succession of random steps.,,,,
"In each step, a random walk may stop at a probability of ps or move to a neighboring item (i.e., a user, a word, or a tweet) with a probability proportional to the edge weight.",,,,
"For example, in Fig.",,,,
"4, a possible random walk is {v1A ??dA2 ??dB1 ??v1B}.",,,,
"Second, we filter invalid random walks.",,,,
Not all random walks are valid in our application.,,,,
"For example, if dA2 is posted after dB1 , the information of dA2 cannot flow to dB1 .",,,,
"In this case, {v1A ??dA2 ??dB1 ??v1B } is invalid.",,,,
"Formally, we say a random walk l is valid if and only if t(d (l1 ) ) ??t(d (l2 ) ) ??... ??t(d (lQ ) ).",,,,
"Here Q is the number of tweets in l , d (lq ) (1 ??q ??Q) is the qth tweet in l , and t(d (lq ) ) denotes the time when d (lq ) was posted.",,,,
"Third, we calculate ck and ?냪k based on the valid random walks.",,,,
"Specifically, ck is the empirical probability that a valid random walk starting from v1A visits v1B: where L(v1A) is the set of valid random walks that start from v1A, L(v1A ??v1B) is the set of val,id ra,ndom walk,""s that start from v1A and reach v1B, and | 쨌 | denotes the cardinality of a set.,""",,,,
"We then calculate ?냪k by averaging the lead-lag time inferred from valid random walks: where d (lQ??) is the last tweet before v1B in random walk l and d (l1 ) is the first tweet in random walk l .,"","",,",,,,
4.3 Identification of Ideas and Their Flows The major challenge in identifying ideas and their flows is to effectively partition the augmented word graph.,,,,
"Traditional graph partition methods cannot be directly applied to an augmented graph, since each edge in the augmented graph is represented by two vectors instead of a real number.",,,,
"To tackle this issue, we use a tensor to model lead-lag within and across multiple groups jointly.",,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"3(a), the augmented word graph consists of words from multiple social groups and temporal correlations, as represented by two vectors.",,,,
"In order to encode this multidimensional data into a consistent model, we first extend the 4-order tensor representation in [53] to a 6-order tensor representation X ??RN횞M횞N횞M횞T 횞(? +1) .",,,,
"In this representation, the first four dimensions encode the two vertices of an edge, the 5th dimension encodes time, and the 6th dimension encodes the lead-lag time.",,,,
"Specifically, we set X nmn??m??kh to ck if, at the kth time point, the lead-lag time between ??vertices vmn and vmn??satisfies ?냪k = h. Otherwise, we set X nmn??m??kh to 0.",,,,
5 V ISUALIZATION According to the requirements discussed in Sec.,,,,
"3.2, we have developed a visualization that combines the strengths of a Voronoitreemap-based bubble tree, a flow map, and a timeline.",,,,
"5.1 Idea View To summarize a large number of ideas (R1.1) and facilitate their exploration at multiple levels of granularity (R1.2), we organize the ideas into a hierarchy by using the Bayesian Rose,Tree,model [3,""7].,""",,,,
"For each idea (or idea cluster) in the hierarchy, we extract its global lead-lag relationships (R1.2).",,,,
"Next, we introduce the visualization techniques developed to illustrate the global lead-lag relationships and idea hierarchy.",,,,
Global lead-lag as glyph.,,,,
"Based on the requirements gleaned from the interview, we represent each idea as meaningful keywords to summarize the core content.",,,,
"Accordingly, the global lead-lag relationships should be placed close to the keywords to facilitate efficient correlation [47].",,,,
"Inspired by the word-sized sparkline visualization [4], we utilize a word-sized glyph to coherently represent idea keywords and associated global lead-lag relationships.",,,,
Our design is shown in Fig.,,,,
5,,,,
"In this design, each social group is represented by a word-sized bar chart.",,,,
The height of the colored bar encodes the proportion of time led by the corresponding social group on the specific idea.,,,,
"Specifically, the height of the colored bar is hb Tl /T , where hb is the total bar height (Fig.",,,,
"5), Tl is the number of time points led by the social group on the specific idea, and T is the total number of time points in the dataset.",,,,
Idea hierarchy as Voronoi-treemap-based bubble tree.,,,,
The experts were interested in both idea clusters (R1.2) and significant ideas in the clusters (R1.1).,,,,
Thus we extract representative ideas for each cluster and display their keywords and global lead-lag relationships along with the high-level clusters.,,,,
The top keywords of each idea cluster are displayed at the bottom of the idea view (Fig.,,,,
1(a)).,,,,
The representative ideas are selected by using topic ranking techniques developed in TIARA [26].,,,,
"In order to summarize the idea clusters with a substantial number of representative ideas, a space-efficient representation of the idea hierarchy is desirable.",,,,
A straightforward choice is a space-filling visualization such as Voronoi treemap [3].,,,,
"However, directly applying the Voronoi treemap would result in difficulties in the global lead-lag glyph layout, since the shapes of the nodes in the Voronoi treemap are often irregular.",,,,
"Moreover, the boundaries of clusters in the Voronoi treemap are not very smooth, which hinders the readability of the clusters [36].",,,,
"To solve these problems, we combined the Voronoi treemap with EulerSmooth [36] to generate a space-efficient bubble tree as shown in Fig.",,,,
1(a).,,,,
Layout.,,,,
"To layout the bubble tree, we first use Voronoi treemap to generate a compact layout of the representative ideas and the idea clusters at the user-selected granularity.",,,,
Then we refine the layout by using EulerSmooth.,,,,
EulerSmooth is a force-directed method for boundary improvement of Euler diagrams.,,,,
"We chose EulerSmooth because it is able to 1) ensure ideas (represented by keywords and \x0cglobal lead-lag glyphs) do not overlap with each other; 2) generate smoothed, aesthetically pleasing bound,aries,for idea,""clusters; and 3) ensure ideas remain inside the boundaries of their idea clusters during the refinement.,""",,,,
"After the refinement, we place the global lead-lag glyphs of idea clusters beside the smoothed boundaries, and refine the layout again by using EulerSmooth.",,,,
Interaction.,,,,
The bubble tree empowers users to examine the ideas at multiple levels of granularity (R1.2).,,,,
A user can select an idea cluster to zoom in or click the zoom out button (Fig.,,,,
1E) to return to high-level views.,,,,
Staged animation [2] is used to preserve a user's mental map during the zoom process.,,,,
We also employ a polygonclipping algorithm [45] to better show how idea clusters split into sub-clusters or how sub-clusters merge during the animation.,,,,
5.2 Flow View Fig.,,,,
1(b) shows a flow map view that combines several visualizations to address the exploration requirements of the domain experts (Sec.,,,,
3.2).,,,,
"Specifically, we encode multi-level user groups as a stripe tree (R2.2, R2.3) and local lead-lag as flow maps [6] (R2.1).",,,,
"The flow map is coordinated with a focus+context timeline, which enables multi-resolution exploration of time (R2.2).",,,,
Multi-level social group as stripe tree.,,,,
Fig.,,,,
"1(b) shows a stripe tree, which consists of a stacked tree [49] and user group stripes.",,,,
Each node in the stacked tree represents a social group.,,,,
"For each leaf node in the stacked tree, we display its activeness over time by using a stripe.",,,,
The activeness is defined as the total number of tweets posted by the users in this group at the specific time point.,,,,
"In our first implementation, we place social group names (e.g., ?쏳epublicans?? on the left side of the stripes.",,,,
"When we presented this implementation to P1, he felt it was difficult to recognize social group names when he observed idea flows.",,,,
He said he had to move his eyes back and forth to check for social group names when he tried to understand the idea flows.,,,,
"Even worse, he might confuse the group names with the content keywords on each stripe.",,,,
"Following his suggestion, we implemented a watermark design (Fig.",,,,
1G) and showed both implementations to 12 potential users.,,,,
"Nine of them preferred the watermark design and all of them agreed that the watermark does not influence their exploration of the idea flows because of enough contrast between the white watermark an,d the,keywords,"".,""",,,,
Thus we adopted the watermark design in our final system.,,,,
Interaction.,,,,
The stacked tree enables users to explore social groups at multiple levels of granularity (R2.2).,,,,
Users can click a leaf node of the stacked tree to zoom into lower level social groups or click an intermediate node to zoom out.,,,,
We use staged animation to smooth the zoom in/out transition and preserve users??mental maps.,,,,
Local lead-lag as flow map.,,,,
"Mathematically, local lead-lag relationships between ideas can be formulated as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).",,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"6(a), each node in the DAG represents an idea from a social group at a specific time.",,,,
The nodes are vertically ordered and placed by using an algorithm developed by Xu et al. [50].,,,,
The color of the node represents the idea cluster it belongs to.,,,,
Two ideas are connected by a directed edge if one leads the other.,,,,
"In this way, the DAG encodes within group lead-lag ????????(e.g., edge AB), across group lead-lag (e.g., AC), and lead-lag time.",,,,
"????Each edge is assigned a weight (e.g., c?k on edge AB) that encodes the correlation between corresponding ideas from multiple groups.",,,,
"A straightforward way to visualize the DAG is to use Sankey diagrams [33], a widely-used method for visualizing weighted information flow.",,,,
"However, Sankey diagrams may cause visual clutter when they are used to display flows between many categories [49].",,,,
Another option is to use edge bundling [16] to merge the flows and reduce clutter.,,,,
"However, edge bundling may cause many crossings and thus introduce unnecessary visual clutter [6].",,,,
"To solve the problem, we use flow maps since they can effectively reduce visual clutter by merging edges quickly and smoothly [6, 10].",,,,
Layout.,,,,
Flow maps are designed to analyze the movement of objects from one source location to multiple target locations [32].,,,,
Each flow map contains one source node and multiple target nodes.,,,,
"Since there are many source nodes (i.e., nodes with outgoing edges) in the DAG, we need to layout many flow maps, which may result in visual clutter and ambiguity.",,,,
"To effectively layout multiple flow maps simultaneously and avoid ambiguity, we have developed a correlated-clustering-based flow map layout algorithm that consists of the following steps.",,,,
The first step is ambiguity-aware filtering.,,,,
"In this step, we reduce ambiguity of the DAG by filtering the less important edges.",,,,
Importance is measured by the edge weight c?k .,,,,
"To measure ambiguity, we employ four metrics proposed in AmbiguityVis [46], namely node occlusion (gok ), edge crossing (gck ), edge crossing angle (gak ), and node-edge occlusion (gnk ).",,,,
"For each edge, we use the four metrics to calculate gk , which is the amount of ambiguity caused by this edge.",,,,
"Specifically, gk is defined as 쨉o gok + 쨉c gck + 쨉a gak + 쨉n gnk , where 쨉o , 쨉c , 쨉a , and 쨉n are parameters that balance the four ambiguity metrics.",,,,
"In IdeaFlow, we set 쨉o = 쨉c = 쨉n = 1 and 쨉a = 0.01.",,,,
We filter the kth edge if c?k ??款 gk .,,,,
Here c?k is the weight of the edge and 款 is a user-provided parameter that balances ambiguity and the amount of information provided.,,,,
"The default value of 款 is set to 0.02, which we find generates acceptable layout results in many cases.",,,,
We also allow users to adjust 款 based on their information needs by using a slider (Fig.,,,,
1J).,,,,
Fig.,,,,
6(b) shows the DAG after applying ambiguity-aware filtering.,,,,
The second step is correlated clustering.,,,,
"In this step, we calculate the join nodes of the flow maps.",,,,
Join nodes are nodes where the edges merge (Fig.,,,,
6(c)).,,,,
"A state-of-the-art algorithm [6] calculates join nodes by clustering the target nodes (e.g., Fig.",,,,
6C) into a spiral tree.,,,,
"When there are multiple source nodes, this algorithm clusters target nodes of each source node independently.",,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"6(c), while this algorithm does reduce the visual clutter of the DAG, it may fail to merge adjacent edges of different source nodes, causing unnecessary visual clutter.",,,,
"To solve this problem, we use correlated clustering [17] to simultaneously build multiple spiral trees.",,,,
As shown in Fig.,,,,
"6(d), our algorithm is able to detect similar structures that belong to different flow maps and merge corresponding edges to further reduce visual clutter.",,,,
The final step is smoothing.,,,,
"In this step, we connect the join \x0cnodes and target nodes by using cubic Bezier curves.",,,,
The control points of the cubic Bezier curves are placed so that the derivative of the incoming curve and outgoing curve are the same at the place where they intersect.,,,,
This results in a smoother transition across different flow maps (Fig.,,,,
6(e)).,,,,
Focus+context timeline as spring.,,,,
"The stripe tree and flow map are coupled with a multi-focus timeline, which aims to facilitate the comparison and exploration of idea flows at multiple levels of time granularity (R2.2).",,,,
"To effectively convey the compression of time, we use a spring metaphor inspired by thread weaving in TextFlow [8].",,,,
"Specifically, the spring metaphor encodes the number of time points compressed in the frequency of the spring (Fig.",,,,
1(b)).,,,,
Interaction.,,,,
"Users can select a time period by clicking the timeline, then expand or shrink it by dragging the left or right side of the time period.",,,,
"During the dragging process, the flow map visualization and user group stripes are updated in real-time.",,,,
"If enough space is given, the time period will split into multiple time periods with a smaller time granularity.",,,,
User action on the timeline will be automatically recorded and displayed in the timeline action trail panel (Fig.,,,,
"1H), which enables users to label the time period and easily return to previous time periods (R2.2).",,,,
"5.3 Information Panel To facilitate the exploration of the source data in full detail (R3), we designed an information panel that consists of four components: a word panel, a user panel, a tweet pan,""el, a"",nd a time,""line action trail panel.,""",,,,
Users can click an idea flow to observe its key content in the word and tweet panel (R3.1) and identify the key users by observing the user panel (R3.2).,,,,
"6 E VALUATION In this section, a quantitative evaluation and two case studies were conducted to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of IdeaFlow.",,,,
"The following two Twitter datasets were used in the evaluation: ??Congress dataset A, which contains 1,605,361 tweets posted by 1,102 Twitter accounts from the members of the 114th U.S. Congress (Ja,nuary,2010 to,""March 2016).,""",,,,
These accounts were manually identified and labeled by a master's student of communications.,,,,
We classified the accounts into four groups: Democratic or Republican Senators and Democratic or Republican House Representatives.,,,,
"??Ebola dataset B, which contains 16,711,670 tweets posted by 321,114 accounts from July 2014 to February 2016.",,,,
We grouped the accounts according to the location information in Twitter profiles.,,,,
Locations were cleaned and organized into a hierarchy using a location enrichment API [55].,,,,
The datasets were processed using the following three steps.,,,,
"First, we grouped the tweets into different segments, each of which contained one day of tweets.",,,,
"In total, we got 2,253 segments (time points) for Dataset A and 574 segments (time points) for Dataset B.",,,,
"Second, we built a correlation model (Fig.",,,,
4) for each time point k based on kth to (k + ? )th segments and used this model to calculate ck and ?냪k .,,,,
Here we set ? to 3.,,,,
"In our experience, this setting well balances model accuracy and efficiency.",,,,
"Third, we constructed the augmented word graph by using ck and ?냪k and used tensor-based techniques (Sec.",,,,
4.3) to identify the ideas and lead-lag relationships.,,,,
"Overall, it took 17 hours to process Dataset A and 9 hours to process Dataset B on a workstation with an Intel Xeon E52630 CPU (2.4 GHz) and 64GB Memory.",,,,
"We extracted 300 ideas and 27,802 lead-lag relationships from Dataset A and 100 ideas and 2,568 leadlag relationships from Dataset B.",,,,
"6.1 Quantitative Evaluation In this experiment, we demonstrated that by taking into account tweet content, meta-data, and correlation between time series, the model accuracy was substantially improv,""ed.,"",,",,,,
Baselines.,,,,
We compared our algorithm with two baselines.,,,,
The first baseline (B1) was the method developed by Zhong et al. [53].,,,,
This method uses cointegration to track idea flows and is limited to two groups.,,,,
"In order to compare it with our method, we substituted their tensor representation with ours, so that it could track lead-lag changes within and across multiple groups.",,,,
The second baseline (B2) was similar to our method.,,,,
The only difference was that it does not take into account the cointegration between word time series.,,,,
We designed B2 to examine whether model accuracy will be improved by adding cointegration information.,,,,
Experimental settings.,,,,
"In the experiment, we measured two kinds of model accuracy: idea accuracy and lead-lag relationship accuracy.",,,,
"Here, accuracy is defined as the proportion of ideas/flows that are labeled to be correct [56].",,,,
We invited two PhD students majoring in data mining to label whether the ideas and lead-lag relationships were correct.,,,,
Both students have experience in data labeling and were familiar with the datasets.,,,,
"For each idea, we provided the students with the top 10 keywords and tweets regarding this idea.",,,,

"5.1 Time-varying Visualization of Sentiment Changes Here, we visualize sentiment changes and its tendency using the ECM on Topic A and Topic B. \x0cFig.7 (c) is denser and has smaller rotator than t,hose,in Fig.6,""(c).,""",,,,
"Using our model, it could be explained that people tend to post micro-blog with more extreme sentiments in Li Zhuang Case than in Guo Meimei Case.",,,,
"5.2 Visual analysis of micro-blog sentiment based on geography network Three topics B, C and D are visualized to show the distribution of sentiments with the regions, and retweeting connections amon,g cit,""ies.,"",",,,,
The results of Topic B are seen as clear evidence in Fig.8 that it triggered a nationwide discussion.,,,,
This event caused much controversy and was debated over the Chinese legal system and also attracted academic attention.,,,,
Topic B has the largest number of active cities in the three topics.,,,,
The schematic view of sentiment influence in the lower right corner shows that public sentiments to this event are very strong.,,,,
"Topic C has several active cities such as Beijing, Hongkong, By comparing Fig.6 (a) and (b), we can see that users??sentiments mainly transit from positive to negative under the influence of Guo Mei,mei C,ase and m,""ost of them are concentrated in a slightly negative area.,""",,,,
We can draw similar conclusions from Fig.7 (a) and (b).,,,,
User density in Fig.6 (b) is lower than that in Fig.7 (b) in the area close to nucleus.,,,,
So we can tell that Li Zhuang Case can influence more people to post more negative messages.,,,,
"Considering the dynamic visualization process and the results of visualization in Fig.6 (c) and Fig.7 (c), the majority of micro-blog sentiments transit from positive to negative.",,,,
Electrons tend to contract from external to inner.,,,,
Only a few micro-blog sentiments transit from the inner to external.,,,,
"As a result, we can infer the public sentiment was influenced by Guo Meimei Case and Li Zhuang Case and was cast down by both of them.",,,,
"However, that the two cases generated different influences can still be inferred by contrasting Fig.6 (c) and Fig.7 (c).",,,,
"Obviously the trajectory in \x0c(c) Topic D Figure 8: Visualizations of micro-blog sentiment based on geography for three topics and Wuhan, illustrated in Fig.8.",,,,
Most users in other cities retweeted the original message posted by users in Beijing.,,,,
A large number of users in Hongkong retweeted the micro-blog posts eijing and Wuhan.,,,,
"Besides, the low density of the lines indicates that Topic C does not cause much social concern.",,,,
Many users think it as a commercial speculation and are not willing to pay attention to it.,,,,
"We can see that for topic D retweeting connections among Beijing, Shanghai and Changsha are very strong.",,,,
And the users in Kunming expressed negative sentiments clearly.,,,,
"Because an event similar to Topic D also happened in Kunming, local users expressed more sympathy for Miss Deng and condemned the official more strongly than other cities.",,,,
The negative sentiment shown in the schematic view of sentiment influence is stronger than Topic B and C. Geographical layout of public sentiment is discussed in Sec 4.3.,,,,
The multi-level parameter H can be adjusted by keyboard to reveal details of different levels.,,,,
As illustrated in Fig.,,,,
"9 (a), the layout of public sentiment is shown in a low level when H is set 30.",,,,
We just see the overall trend of distribution of public sentiment.,,,,
"If the value of H is halved to 15, some difference appears.",,,,
By zoom and pan operations we can see local details.,,,,
"The public sentiment in Nanjing is negative while the public sentiments in the cities near to Nanjing such as Shanghai, Hangzhou are positive.",,,,
"When H is relatively large and sentiment influences for cities are wide, the negative sentiment in Nanjing will be offset by the stronger positive sentiments in the cities close to Nanjing.",,,,
Comparing Fig.,,,,
"9 (b) and (c), the distribution edges in Fig.",,,,
9 (c) is more even and clear than Fig.,,,,
9 (b)'s.,,,,
"According to the discussion in Sec 4.2, we reduce the degree of edge bundling when the view window is zoomed into.,,,",,,,
