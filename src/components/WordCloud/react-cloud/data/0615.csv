Pair-wise Visual Connection and Comparison
Comparison
 provide a general solution supporting pair-wise comparison of multi-item data streams
pair-wise visual connection and comparison of multi-item data streams
both qualitative and quantitative comparisons
Comparison of data stream dynamics: Compare the temporal or sequential patterns,Compare the temporal or sequential patterns
Comparison of items,qualitative comparison,quantitative comparison,
Comparison of comparisons,Compare overall similarity difference patterns
Comparison of sub-stream pairs
abstracted visual summary of dynamic similarity-difference patterns ,Summaries for different sub-stream pairs can be compared.
supporting comparison of two streams
presenting their similarities and differences
Qualitative comparison of the presence of items
detailed exploration
observe the overall temporal pattern
exploring different aspects of the data streams
Comparative exploration of the tweets
Visual Summary Level: Comparison of Comparison
iterative exploration and Comparison of comparisons,compare multiple aspects of the two data streams
